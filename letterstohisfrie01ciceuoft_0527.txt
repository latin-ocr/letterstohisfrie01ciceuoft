EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. xn.

of writing to you in such a way as rather to console
a brave and wise man than to lay before you any
assured hope of your restoration, except what, once
this conflagration had been extinguished, Ι thought
might justly be expected from the Republic itself.
Remind yourself of your own letters to me, in which
you have ever displayed a high spirit, resolute, and
prepared to bear whatever might befall ; and I was
not surprised at it when Ι remembered that you had
been engaged in public affairs from the earliest years
of your life, and that the tenure of your public offices
coincided with the most critical periods in the welfare
and fortunes of the whole community ; yes, and that
you entered this very war not merely to play the
happy victor, but also, should it so befall, if van-
quished, the philosopher.

In the next place, since you devote your literary 5
activities to putting on record the exploits of men
of courage, it is your duty to reflect that you cannot
afford to do anything to disprove your own close
resemblance to those whom you eulogize.

But this sort of talk would be better suited to
those times from which you have now escaped. As it
is you have only to prepare yourself to join with us
in enduring present conditions3 could Ι but discover
a remedy for them, Ι should pass that same on to you.
We have, however, one refuge—that learning and
literature of which we have always availed ourselves ;
in prosperity we regarded them as a source of pleasure
only, now we regard them as our very salvation.

But, to revert to what Ι said at first, you must
never have any doubt but that everything connected

with your restoration and return has been fully
accomplished.
