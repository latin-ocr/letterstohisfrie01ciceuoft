EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. 11.

state, Ι beg you to forgive me ; for I am as great a
friend of the state as the greatest friend she has.
If, however, I have but defended my persona] safety
against his most merciless attack upon me, you must
rest content that I make no complaint to you either
of your brother’s injustice to me.

Now when I had discovered that he was directing
every effort he could make as tribune ‘² to my destruc-
tion, and laying his plans accordingly, I appealed to
your wife, Claudia,⁶ and to your sister Mucia ⁶ too, of
whose desire to serve me, in consideration of my in-
timacy with Pompey, I had assured myself on several
occasions, to deter him from so injurious a policy.

And yet, as I know for certain that you were told, 7
on the last day of December he inflicted upon me,
consul and saviour of the Republic as I was, an
indignity such as has never yet been inflicted upon
any man holding the lowest office in the state, were
he the most disloyal of citizens—he robbed me, on
laying down my office, of the privilege of address-
ing the people ; but that indignity after all resulted
in my being most highly honoured. For though he
permitted me to do no more than merely take the
oath, I took that oath, and a very true and glorious
oath it was, in a loud voice; and the people also
swore as loudly that that same oath I had sworn
was true.‘¹

⁹ A woman of the worst reputation, identified with the
Lesbia of Catullus. See note a on p. 320.

⁰ Half-sister of the two Metelli and wife of Pompey, by
whom she was afterwards divorced.

⁶ The words of the oath were rem publicam atque hano
urbem mea unius opera esse salvam, ‘⁶ that the safety of the
state and this city is due to my efforts alone.”
