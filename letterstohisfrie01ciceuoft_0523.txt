EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. ΧΠ.

felicity, and then be suddenly crushed and so cast
down that nothing could ever afterwards raise
your spirits even to the point of composure. I
have pleaded your cause more openly than my own
political position warranted 3 for the very misfortune
of my diminished influence was outweighed by my
affection and my unceasing love for you, which
you have yourself so assiduously fostered. All the
promises bearing upon your return and restoration
have been confirmed, certified, and ratified ; Ι have
seen, examined, taken part in everything.

In fact, opportunely enough, I have all Caesar’s 2
intimate friends so closely bound to me by familiar
acquaintance and kindly feeling that, after him, they
account me next. This Pansa,“ Hirtius‚⁶ Balbus,⁶
Oppius,d Matius ⁶ and Postumus,f do so absolutely
that their affection for me stands alone. Had I been
obliged to secure this by my own personal efforts, I
should not, considering the nature of the times,
regret having made such efforts. But in no respect
have I played the time—server. Here my old ties
of friendship with all these men come in, and Ι have
never ceased to plead with them on your behalf.
My chief support, however, I have found in Pansa (a
man devotedly attached to you, and anxious to be
friends with me), since he had influence with Caesar,
not less because of his strong personality than

Octavius, and was consul in 40, being the first foreigner
to hold that office.

‘¹ C. Oppius was always closely connected with Balbus
in the service of Caesar.

‚ 0 C. Matius was devotedly attached to Caesar. See
Khsaelirobably M. Curtius Postumus, made tribune of the
soldiers by Caesar at Cicero's instance.
