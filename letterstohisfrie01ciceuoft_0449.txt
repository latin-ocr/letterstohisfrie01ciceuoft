EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. xx.

my orders3 and that money Pompey has used, as
Sestius used that which you had deposited. But
that, Ι take it, does not affect you at all. I should,
indeed, have been angry with myself for never having
thought of adding an entry, to the effect that it was
by my orders that you had deposited the money in
the Temple, had it not been certified by the most
solemn and incontrovertible records to whom that
money was assigned,·by what decree of the senate,
and by what written instructions on your part or on
mine it was handed over to P. Sestius. For when ,Ι
saw that the whole transaction had been so distinctly
and minutely recorded ‘² as to admit of no mis-
understanding, Ι did not add an entry in which you
were not concerned. And yet I should prefer to have
added it, now that I see you regret its omission.

It is just as you write, ‘⁵ that you were bound to
make that entry '⁹ 3 I am of the same opinion mysclf 3
and in that there will be no discrepancy between
your accounts and mine. You will, I am sure, add
the words “ by my orders ”—words which I certainly
did not add myself3 and there is no reason why I
should deny the omission, nor should I do so, even
if there were a reason, and you obj ected to my denial.

Again‚ as to the nine hundred sestertia, the entry
was made exactly as you, or else your cousin, wished
it to be made. But (since it secmed you were not
altogether pleased in the case of Lucceius), if there is
any correction Ι can make even at this late hour in
handing in the accounts—well, as regards that, Ι
have to consider, seeing that I did not avail myself
of the decree of the Senatess’ what latitude is
allowed me by the laws. At any rate, in the matter
of the money collected, it was no business of yours
