EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IV. 1.-11.

desire. If, however, it seems to a shrewd man like
you to be expedient that we should have a talk,
although it was my intention to remove still further
from the City, which Ι can now hardly bear to hear
named, I shall yet manage to get nearer to you.
And Ι have instructed Trebatius, if there is any
message you want him to send me, not to refuse to
do so ; and I should like you to do so, or to send me
anyone you please of those you can trust, so that it
may not be necessary either for you to quit the City
or for me to approach it. I am paying you as great
a compliment as perhaps I am claiming for myself,
in the assuranee I feel that whatever course you and
I together decide upon will be unanimously approved
by the world. '

TO THE SAME

Cumae, the end of April, 49 mc.

I received your letter on April 28, when I was at
my Cuman villa ; and on reading it I gathered that
Philotimus did not aet quite discreetly when, in
spite of the instructions he had from you (as you
write) on every point, he failed to come to me
himself, and merely forwarded me your letter3 and
I concluded that it was the shorter because you had
imagined that he would deliver it in person. Any-
how, after I had read your letter, your wife Postumia
came to see me, and so did our dear Servius.‘¹
They were of opinion that it was for you to come
to my Cuman house, and they even entreated me
to write to you to that effect.
