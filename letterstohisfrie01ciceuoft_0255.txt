EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, III. x.

however, you manage to bring off the election of
censors, and if you perform the duties of your own
censorship‚ as you ought and as you can, Ι feel sure
you will be a permanent pillar of strength not only
to yourself but to all your relatives. Ι would have
you fight tooth and nail to prevent any extension of
my‘period of office, so that when I have satisfied
your claims upon me here, Ι may be able to demon-
strate my goodwill towards you at home as well.

As to what you tell me of the devotion to you of all 4
men of every class, I am as little surprised as I am
greatly pleased that it has so fallen out ; and I have
had the same account of it from intimate friends of
mine. I am, therefore, highly delighted not only
that all due tribute is paid to you in particular, whose
friendship is as great an honour as a pleasure to me,
but also that there still survives in our state an atti-
tude of devoted attachment, with practically no dis-
sentients, to men of fortitude and energy ; and that
in itself in my own case has ever been the only
reward I have gained by my laborious days and
sleepless nightS.

I am extremely surprised, however, that it has 5
come about that the young man α whom I only saved
from ruin by the greatest exertions in two trialsb
involving capital punishment, should have proved so
utterly reckless as to forget, when he undertook to
represent ⁶ all your enemies, the patron of all his
fortunes and of his whole career; especially when
you had a handsome balance of distinctions, or shall
Ι say safeguards, to your credit, while he, to say the
least of it, had a heavy deficit in these respects. The
silly and childish things he has been saying had
already been fully reported to me by my dear friend
