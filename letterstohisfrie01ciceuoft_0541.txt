EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. xvm.

As regards your business, seeing that you are a 3

matters, returns to Rome, Ι shall not cease to confer ·
with him to find some way out of the difficulty ; for
Ι think he trusts me.

I am extremely glad that you are so favourably 4
impressed with my Orator.⁶ Indeed it is my own
conviction that I have concentrated upon that book
whatever critical ability I possessed on the subject
of oratory. And if the book is really such as you
say you think it is, then I too am of some conse-
-quence; if not, then I have no objection to my
general reputation for critical ability being dis-
paraged in exact proportion to the disparagement
of that particular book. I am anxious that our dear
Lepta,⁶ young as he is, should find pleasure in such
compositions; though his age is hardly ripe for it,
still it can do him no harm to let his ears ring with
language of that kind.

I am detained at Rome in any case by my dear 2
Tullia's confinement. But even when she is strong
again, as I hope she will be, I am still tied by the
leg until I can screw the first instalmentd out of
Dolabella’s agents and, to tell you the truth, I am not
so keen on travelling as I used to be. I used to
delight in my country houses, and their restfulness.
My house here is as comfortable as any of my villas,
and more restful than the most sequestered spot in
the world. So my literary work does not suffer
either ; I am absorbed in it and there is.nothing to
interrupt me, and that is why Ι think I am more
likely to see you here than you are to see me at
your place.
