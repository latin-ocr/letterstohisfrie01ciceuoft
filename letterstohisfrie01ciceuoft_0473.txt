EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. 11.—111.

desire to survive the vRepubhc, even if allowed to do
so, that you must accept your lot, especially as it
has no connexion with any fault of yours. But
enough of this. Ι should like you to write and tell
me what you are doing, and where you are likely to
be, so that I may know either where to write, or
where to come.

CICERO To THE SAME

Rome, J anuary, 45 13.c.

In my last lettera I was tempted by my friendliness, 1
rather than because the circumstances demanded it,
to be somewhat prolix3 for neither did your manliness
require any encouragement of mine, nor, considering
my own utter destitution, was my case and condition
such as to warrant my encouraging anyone else.

On this occasion too I must be briefer. For if 2
there was no need of so many words then, there is
no greater need at all now3 and if there was then,
what I have already written is enough, especially as
there has been nothing new to add. For though I
daily hear something of these affairs, which I believe
reach your ears too, it' all amounts to the same
thing in the end3 and that end I see as clearly
with my mind as the things we behold with our
eyes3 and indeed there is nothing I see which Ι
am not quite sure that you see also. For though
no man can divine what the issue of a battle
will be, Ι can yet see the issue of the war, or, if not
exactly that, Ι can at any rate see, since one side or
the other must necessarily prove victorious, what is
likely to be the effect of victory on either side.
