EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. v1.

.‘'from one so angry ? ” Well, it is obvious to him
⁴that the very same fountain which has (only slightly
'I admit) bespattered him, will offer deep draughts of
praise' ⁴tc· his lips. Finally he is a man of penetrating
intelligence who sees far ahead, and he knows per-
fectly well that a man like you—a man who is by
far thegreatest nobleman in a district of Italy⁰
which he can ill afford to disregard, and who, in the
*state to which we all belong, is the peer of any

the Roman people—cannot be shut out from political
life any longer. He will not want this favour to be
attributed some day to the lapse of time, rather
than immediately to himself.

So much for Caesar. Now as to the nature of our 10
times and circumstances. No man is so bitter an
enemy to the cause which Pompey, with more courage
than calculation, took up as to dare to speak of us as
either disloyal citizens or unprineipled men. And
here I often admire the sobriety and‘ justice and
wisdom of Caesar ; he never refers to Pompey except
in the most complimentary terms. But, you will
object, he has on many occasions treated him as a
pubh’c man θ with undue harshness. Well, that is due
to the clash of arms and to victory, not to Caesar.
Why, how warmly he has welcomed· us -all ! Cassius
he has made his legate ; Brutus he has made gover-
nor of Gaul ; Sulpicius of Greece ; Marcellus, with
whom he was more indignant than any one,·he has
recalled with every consideration for his honour.⁶

What then is the import of all this? It means 11
that the very ‘nature of things and of politics as we
find *hem will not tolerate—no, nor will any system
