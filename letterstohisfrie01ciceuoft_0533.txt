CICERO ΤΟ THE SAME
Rome, September 24, 46 Rc.

Rest assured that I am devoting all my energies‚ 1
all my efforts, care, and zeal to the question of your
recall; for not only have I always had the highest
regard for you, but your brothers also, to whom I
am as warmly attached as to yourself, are so
singularly dutiful to you in their brotherly affection
that they make it impossible for me to omit any act or
opportunity that may prove my eager desire to serve
{gmlf'ff‘gggsslqgtpssessgss ξέἐῗῗεὲἲιὲηζὸἔῖιὲἳῗιῖἕῗεἓξὲξ
rather than from mine.

On the other hand I should like to give you my own
account of my hopes, indeed my confident and
certain assuranee, of your restoration. If any man
in the world is a coward in matters of importance
involving any risk, and always more inclined to
apprehend an unfavourable, than to hope for a
favourable‚ issue, Ι am that man3 and if this be a
weakness, I admit that I am not free from it.

But for all that, pessimist 'as I am, when, four 2
days before the Calends of the first interealary
month,“ at your brothers' request I had made my way
to Caesar early in the day (but not before I had
suffered every kind of humiliation and annoyance
in trying to approach him and securing an interview),
when your brothers and relatives were prostrating
themselves at his feet, and when I had stated all that

the case and your critical position demanded, the
impression left upon my mind when I went away,
