EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IV. xv.

XV

CICERO To THE SAME
Rome, some time in 46 mc.

I am in receipt of your very short letter, which 1
did not enable me to discover what Ι was anxious to
know,though I did discoverwhat I had never doubted.
In other words, how bravely you were bearing our
common calamities, I had no means of learning ; how
sincerely you loved me, Ι could easily perceive ; but
the latter I knew already ; had I known the former,
I should have written accordingly.

But despite the fact that I have previously written 2
as much as I considered ought to be written, I have
yet thought it necessary at such a crisis as this to
caution you briefly not to imagine that you are in any
special danger of your own; we are all in great
danger, but after all it is a common danger. It is
not right then that you should either demand for
yourself alone any special privilege of fortune, or
repudiate the fortune that has befallen us all. Let
us, therefore, continue to be on the same terms of
mutual friendship as we always have been. What
Ι can but hope for in your case, I can guarantee in
my own.
