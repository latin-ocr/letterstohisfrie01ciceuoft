EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IV. xm.

Ι do continue to enjoy Caesar’s extreme courtesy to
me3 but that cannot counterbalance violence and
revolution in every relation of life and in the times
themselves.

And so, bereft of all to which Ι had become 3
habituated by my natural disposition, inclinations,
and daily life, Ι am not only a nuisance to others, as
I am sure I am, but even to myself. For though it
is my very nature to be ever engrossed in some
important work worthy of a man, Ι have now not
only no scheme of aetion, but not even a scheme of
thought. And while hitherto Ι have been in a
position to offer my assistance to obscure or even
guilty men, I am now not in a position to make even
a promise of kindness to Publius Nigidius, incom-
parably the most learned and most virtuous of
men, at one time a universal favourite and to me
assuredly the best of friends. So that style of
letter-writing has been plucked out of my reach.

It only remains for me to comfort you, and to 4
suggest considerations whereby I may try to dis-
traet your thoughts from your miseries. But that
genius for comforting either yourself or another, if
ever man had it, is possessed in its full perfection by
yourself 3 with any such topic, therefore, as has its
source in what I may term the finer pursuits of
learning, I shall not meddle, but leave it entirely to
you. What conduct is worthy of a brave and wise
man, what is imperatively demanded of you by your
dignity, your loftiness of mind, your past history, the
researches and accomplishments for which you have
been distinguished from your boyhood———all that you
will see for yourself. For my part, because I am in
Rome and because I am interested and on the alert,
