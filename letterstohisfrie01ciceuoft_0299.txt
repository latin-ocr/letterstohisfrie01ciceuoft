EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IV. nr.

a little earlier than you did ; and, more than that, 1
declare to you that Ι saw how the whole business was
managed. Please understand this—ever since these
calamities set in, I mean ever since national right
was first submitted to the arbitrament of arms, this
is the only dignified transaction that has occurred.
For Caesar himself, having protested against Mar-
cellus's “ acrimony '⁹ (that is the term he used) and
having eulogized in the most complimentary terms
both your fairness and your far-sightedness, suddenly
and unexpectedly declared that he would not refuse
the request of the Senate in the matter of Marcellus,
in spite of its being a bad omen.“ Now when the
question of Marcellus had been opened by L. Piso?
and when Gaius Marcellusc had flung himself at
Caesar’s feet,the Senate, as it had previously arranged
to do, rose in a body and approached Caesar with
an air of supplication. Not to waste words, this
seemed to me so glorious a day that I imagined Ι saw
before me some fair vision of the Republic rising, as
it were, from the dead. And so when all who had
been asked to speak before me had expressed their
gratitude to Caesar (except Volcatius, who declared,
that had he been in Caesar’s place, he would not have
acted as Caesar did d), on being asked my opinion I
broke my resolution3 for I had determined, not, I
assure you, from indolence, but because I resented
the loss of my former position, never to speak again.
This determination of mine suddenly gave way before
Gaesar's magnanimity and the Senate‘s devotion ⁶ ;
and so I expressed my thanks to Caesar at con-
siderable length ; and I am afraid that in all other
such cases I have cheated myself of the honourable
leisure which was my one solace amid my troubles.
