EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, I. v.

TO 'mm SAME

Rome, February, 56 mc.

Though I could have wished for nothing better
than that my extreme gratitude to you should be
recognized first by yourself, and secondly by every-
one else, still Ι am deeply grieved that the political
developments which followed upon your departure
have been such, that you should have had cause,
while -away from home, to test the loyalty and good-

it clear to me that you quite see and feel that there
is the same general loyalty in support of your claims
as I met with in the matter of my recall.

and turn our thoughts from a lesser anxiety to an over-
whelming dread. Still, though any issue may be
apprehended in so chaotic a state of affairs, there is
nothing we dread more than treachery ; and as for
Cato, we shall certainly oppose him, come what will.

cause I can only promise you this 2— that I shall
satisfy in full measure the expectations both of your-
self who are absent, and of your friends who are
on the spot3 though Ι am afraid that the business
will be either snatched from our hands, or altogether
abandoned, and which alternative I desire less
1 cannot easily determine But if we are hard
