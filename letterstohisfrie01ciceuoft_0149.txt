EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, II. vn.

extent and intensity of my affection, that Ι might
have proved of some assistance to you with my
advice.

I shall write to you more fully in another letter, · 3
for in a few days’ time I am going to send some
private carriers of my own, so that, having now dis-
charged a public duty with distinct success and to ,
my own satisfaction‚ I may send the Senate in a
single dispatch a detailed account of the achieve-
ments of the whole summer.a

As to your election to the priesthood,¹² you will
be informed in the letter I have entrusted to your
freedman, Thraso, what attention I have given it,
and how difficult the business, and your particular
case, has been.

I adjure you, my dear Curio, in the name of your 4
Δ extraordinary friendship for me, and of mine, in-
comparable as it 1s, for you, not to allow any extension
of time to be made in this irksome provincial govern-
ment of mine.

I pleaded with you in person, when I little thought
that you would be tribune of the plebs for this year,
and Ι frequently repeated the petition by letter,
but then it was addressed as it were to a very dis-
tinguished partisan, though a most popular young
man, whereas now it is addressed to a tribune of the
plebs, and that tribune Curi03 and my petition
is, not that some fresh decree should be passed,
which is often a matter of considerable difficulty,
but that no fresh decree at all should be passed,
and that you should maintain the existing deerees
of the Senate and the laws, and that the same
terms should remain in force as when I left Rome.
This Ι earnestly beg of you again and again.
