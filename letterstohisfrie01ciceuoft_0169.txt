EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, ΙΙ. xm,

especially when he is a colleague of mine as augur,
and even in dealing with the fame and erudition of
our College has proved his devotion to me ? I have

the publicani the arrears (just think of it) of the past
five years without the slightest protest on the
part of the allies, and have made myself pleasant
