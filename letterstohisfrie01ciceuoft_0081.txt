EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, Ι. 1x.

IX

Μ. CICERO To P. LENTULUS, 1MPERATOR⁰
Rome, December, 54 mc.

I was very much pleased with your letter, which 1
made me realize that you fully appreciate my
devotion to you; for why should I say “ my good-
will '’ when even that term “ devotion ’' itself, most
solemn and sacred as it is, does not seem to me
impressive enough to describe my obligation to
you ? But when you write that you are grateful to
me for my exertions on your behalf, by a sort of
overflow of affection you represent those acts, which
could not be omitted without perpetrating an
atrocious crime, as actually deserving of gratitude.
My feelings towards you, however, would have
been better recognized and more marked, if all this
time during which we have been separated we had
been together and at Rome.

For in that very line of action you plainly declare 2
that you will adopt-no man is better qualified to
do so, and I eagerly look ‘to you to do so—I mean
in speaking in the Senate, and in every sphere of
public life and political administration, we should
have made our mark (what is my own feeling and
position in politics Ι shall explain a little later, and
at the same time reply to your questions) 3 at any
rate I should have found in you a supporter most
kindly and most wise, and you in me a counsellor
always been a friendly admirer of Pompey‚ he was drawn
closer to Caesar by the latter’s generosity to himself and
intimacy with his brother Quintus, now on Caesar's staff, and

he had even become reconciled, superficially at least, with
the triumvir he had always hated, Μ. Crassus.
