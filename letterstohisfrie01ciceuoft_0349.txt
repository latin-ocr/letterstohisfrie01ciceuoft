EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IV. xxv.

my old position ; in the other you expressed a hope
that the arrangement I had made ⁰ might turn out
well and happily. Well if ‘⁴ position '' means the
holding of sound political opinions, and making those
opinions acceptable to men of sound character, I
certainly do maintain my position ; but if “ position ''
consists in the ability to give practica] effect to your
opinions, or even merely to defend them with fre'edom
of speech, why, then I have no vestige of position
left me, and we are doing exeeedingly well if we
can but school ourselves to endure with sels-control
those evils, some of which have already befallen us,
and others are hanging over us ; and it is hard to do
so in a war of this sort,⁶ the issue of which on one
side threatens massacre, and on the other slavery.
At this dangerous crisis Ι feel some slight con-
solation, when Ι recall that I foresaw all this, at the
time when Ι was seriously alarmed even at our
successes and not at our failures alone, and saw how
great was the risk of submitting a point of constitu-
tional right to the arbitrament of arms. For suppos-
ing that, by means of those arms, the party I had been
drawn to join, not by any desire for war, but by the
hope of arranging a peace, had proved victorious, I
was none the less aware how sanguinary was bound to
be the victory of men so angry, so rapacious‚ and so
arrogant 3 and if on the other hand they were to be

defeated, how crushing was bound to be the ruin of
my fellow-eitizens‚ some of them men of the highest

rank, others of the highest character also, but men
who, when I foretold all this and took the wisest
measures for their safety, were more anxious that I
should be regarded as showing undue timidity than
proper prudence.
