EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IV. xm.

even contemplating anything of the kind. There
still remained a certain style of correspondence
appropriate to these times of ours in its gloom and
melancholy ; but Ι cannot fall back even upon that.
For even that should surely convey either the promise
of some substantial help or some consolation for your
grief. Ι have no promise to make ; for humiliated
as I am by a misfortune like your own, it is only by
extraneous assistance that I bear the weight of my
afflictions‚ and my heart is more often inclined to
deplore the conditions, than to rejoice in the fact,
of my being alive.

Although I have not myself personally been the
victim of any particularly glaring act of inj ustice, and
though it has never occurred to me even under
present conditions to desire anything which Caesar
has not spontaneously bestowed upon me, still none
the less, so crushing are my anxieties, that I do not
think I am acting aright even in remaining alive at
all. For I have lost not only numbers of my most
intimate friends, either torn away from me by death,
or dragged from my side by banishment, but also
all those friends whose affection I had won by the
part I once played, in conjunction with yourself,‘⁸
in the successful defence of the Republic; and all
around me Ι see the shipwrecks of their fortunes and
the pillaging of their possessions ; and not only do I
hear of it, which would in itself be a misery to me,
but I actually see, and it is the most distressing sight
in the world, the squandering of the property of those
men with whose assistance we once extinguished that
awful conflagration3 and in the very city in which
but lately I was richly blessed in popularity, influence,
and fame, of all that there is now nothing left me.
