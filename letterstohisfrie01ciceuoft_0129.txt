EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, II. 1.

had two or three letters from you at the most, and
those very short ones. Τ herefore if you judge me
harshly, I shall find you guilty on the same charge 3
if you don’t want me to do so, you will have to be
lenient with me. , But no more about correspondence 3
I am not afraid of failing to give you your fill of letters,
effoeiapytff yolu show a proper appreciation of my
e orts m a 'ne.

Ι have grieved at your long absence from among 2
us, because Ι have not been able to enjoy your most
agreeable society, but at the same time Ι rejoice
that while absent you have attained all your obj ects
with the greatest honour to yourself, and that in
all your affairs fortune has answered my prayers.
There is a little piece of advice which my extra-
ordinary affection for you compels me to offer you.
So much is expected of your courage, or, it may be of
your capacity, that I do not hesitate to beg and
beseech you to return to us in such a frame of mind α
as to be able to uphold and justify all the expecta-
tions you have excited. And while it is true that
no forgetfulness will ever efface the memory of what
you have done for me, Ι beg you to remember that,
whatever enhancements of fortune or honour may
accrue to you in the future, you could never have
secured them, had you not in the old days of your
boyhood hearkened to the advice given you in all
sincerity and affection by myself. And that is why
your feelings towards me should be such, that,
burdened as I am·with the increasing weight of
years, I should find repose in your love and in your
youth. ’
