EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. 1.—11.

kindly feeling and wisdom is, I am sure, a comfort
to you3 had we but followed his authority and
counsel we should have submitted to the autocracy
of a civilian rather than to the victory of an armed
soldier.⁰
But perhaps Ι have dealt with these matters at 7

unnecessary length3 Ι shall take less space to set
forth what is more important. Ι have nobody in the
world to whom I owe more than I do to you ; those
to whom I was indebted, you yourself know how
heavily, have been snatched away from me by the
calamity of this war. What my own position is at
the present moment I am fully aware. But since
there is never a man so hopelessly prostrate but
that he is capable of some considerable accomplish-
ment and performance if he devotes himself wholly
and solely to the work he has in hand, I should be
glad if you would regard whatever counsel or prac-
tical assistance I can give you, certainly all my

effigusmsm' as a debt I owe to yourself and your
c 1 ren.
