EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, ΙΙ. 111.

meet it, I shall take you unprepared, and pit my
view of the matter against yours, face to face, so
that Ι may either bring you over to my way of
thinking, or at any rate leave on record in your
mind a duly attested declaration of my convictions,
so that if ever you begin—I hope you never will—-
to be dissatisfied with your own decision, you may
be able to recall mine. To put it shortly, however, ’
you may take it from me that on your return you
will find such a condition of affairs in general that
you will more easily secure all political distinctions
by means of the blessings bestowed upon you by
nature, by your enthusiasm,‘² and by fortune, than
by public spectacles ; the ability to give them excites
no admiration, for it is a sign of wealth, and not
of worth3 and there is nobody who is not now sick
and tired of them.

But I am not acting as I declared I would 3 l am
entering upon a reasoned explanation of my views 3
so I postpone all discussion of this until you arrive.
Let me assure you that you are most eagerly awaited‚
and that such things are expected of you as are
naturally to be expected of pre-eminence in merit and
capacity3 and if you are prepared, as you ought to
be, to satisfy such anticipations, and I am sure it is'
so, why, then the shows ὁ with which you are sure to
delight us, your friends, the whole body of your
fellow-citizens, and the state, will be in the highest
degree varied and magnificent. But there is one
thing which you will assuredly discover—that nobody
in the world is dearer or more delightful to me than
yourself.
