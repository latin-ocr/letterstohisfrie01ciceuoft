EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, Ι. v11.

position, and policy you had defended, were not so
mindful of your merits, as resentful of your renown.
At that time, as I wrote in detail to you before, I
found Hortensius unreservedly your friend, Lucullus
devoted to your cause, and L. Racilius‚⁰ among the
magistrates, exceptionally loyal and well-disposed ; for
my own defence and vindicationvof your claims might
perhaps, in view of your extraordinary generosity to
me, appear to most people to be prompted rather by
a sense of obligation than an unbiased conviction.
Further than that, I cannot testify as to the zeal or 3

deference or friendliness of any single one of the
consulars, for Pompey, who very often talks to me
about you, not only when I lead him on to do so,
but even of his own accord, did not, as you know,
often attend the Senate on those occasions ; but your
last letter to him, as Ι could easily understand, gave
him very great pleasure. To me your considerate
courtesy, or rather your consummate wisdom‚
seemed as charming as it was wonderful. Here is an
excellent man whom you had laid under an obliga-
tion to you by an act of remarkable generosity, but
who had his suspicions that because of what certain
persons thought of his eagerness for office you were
estranged from him—this man’s friendship, by the
writing of that letter, you have retained. He has
always, 1 believe, favoured your high reputation even
in those very dubious days of Caninius’s ⁶ activity ;
but since the perusal of your letter I am absolutely
assured that you and your distinctions and your
interests occupy his whole mind. So when I write 4
this, you must be so good as to understand that I write

Ptolemy, when Lentulus and his friends might well have
suspected I'ompey of hostile rivalry in that affair.
