EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, II. xix.

you3 and the carrier who delivered it was not the
man to whom you had handed it, in which case he
might have told me. from what place or at what time
it had been dispatched.

Anyhow, uncertain as things were, Ι thought I 2
should make a point of sending my orderlies and
lictors to you with a letter; and if you receive it in
time enough, you will do me a very great favour if
you join me in Cilicia as soon as possible.

For what Curius, your cousin, and a man, as you
know, to whom Ι am greatly attached, and C. Vergilius ‘²
also, your kinsman and my very intimate friend, have
written to me about you with such careful elaboration
has, of course, great influence with me, as the studied
recommendation of men who are emphatically my
friends is bound to have; but your own letter,
especially on the subject of your position, and our
being thus associated, carries more weight with me
than anything else. No more desirable quaestor
could possibly have fallen to my lot. And that is
why any such marks of distinction as can find their
way from me to you, will so find their way, that
the world may recognize that I have shown no lack
of regard for your own and your ancestors' prestige.
But Ι can the more easily effect this if you join me
in Cilicia3 and that Ι regard as of importance to me
and to the state, and most of all to yourself.
