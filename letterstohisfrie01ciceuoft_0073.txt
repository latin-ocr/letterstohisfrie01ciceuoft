EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, I. vn.

energy ; those who have the superiority in resources,
arms, and power, seem to me, thanks to the stupidity
and inconsistency of their opponents,‘¹ to have made
such progress, as to be now superior in moral in-
fluence as well; and so with very few dissentients
they have gained through the Senate all they
thought they were unlikely to attain, even through
the people, without an insurrection 3 for Caesar has
not only been given money for his troops and ten
lieutenant commanders by a decree, but they
easily managed to prevent his being superseded
under the Lex Sempronia.b

I write somewhat briefly on this point, because
this position of affairs gives me no satisfaction ; still Ι
do write just to warn you—and this is a lesson that
even I, devoted as Ι have been from a boy to all kinds
of literature, have still learnt better from practical
experience than from books—to be taught while
your prosperity is still intact, that we must
neither consider our safety to the detriment of
our dignity, nor our dignity to the detriment of our
safet .

Yosu congratulate me on the engagement of my ll
daughter to Crassipes 3 I appreciate your courtesy,
and hope and pray the alliance will be a source of
pleasure to us. Our dear Lentulus, being, as he is, 12
a youth who shows conspicuous promise of the highest
excellence, you must be careful to educate not only in
all the accomplishments to which you have yourself
always been devoted, but especially by making him
follow in your footsteps 3 you can give him no better
tuition than that. I have a special affection for him

beforehand by the consuls for 55, Caesar would be ipso
sacto superseded in 54.
