EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IV. xm.

Ι am in a position to read the signs and feel the
truth of what Ι now deelare to you—that you will
not much longer have to endure the harassing
conditions under which you are living at present,
but the conditions which I share with you perhaps

you will have to endure for ever.
It seems to me quite clear, in the first place, that 5

the very man who has most to say in the matter is
decidedly disposed to sanction your restoration. Ι
am not writing thus at random. The less my intimacy
with him, the more searching are my investigations.
It is only to make it easier for him to give a less
favourable reply to those with whom he is more angry
than with you, that he has hitherto been dilatory
in delivering you from your distress. As a matter
of fact it is surprising how well those who are in close
touch with him, and indeed those in whose company
he finds most pleasure, both speak and think of you.
Add, moreover, the goodwill of the commons, or
rather the unanimity of all classes. Even our great
Republic herself whose power, it is true, is now at its
lowest (but power she is bound to have), whatever her
strength may be, will at an early date, believe me,
prevail upon the very men, who now hold her in
subjection‚ to grant this boon on your behalf.

I therefore come back to this-I now even make 6
you a promise, which at first I forebore to make. It
is my intention to make friends with those in elosest
touch with him, who already have a high regard for
me, and are much in my company, and, moreover,
to worm myself into familiarity with the great man
himself—a familiarity from which I have been
hitherto shut out by my own lack of sels—asserum,
and I shall not fail to follow up every opening
