EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, III. 1.

passed from me to you has turned out to be very
acceptable to you. And that being so, I shall
assuredly guarantee to repair the enjoyment of the
many days we have lost through the interruption
of our intimacy α by the acceptability, ,the frequency,
and the magnitude of my services to you; and, as
itis your wish too, I may say that Ι shall do so “ not
against Minerva’s will '' ὁ ; and if I secure a statue of
her from your collection, Ι shall entitle her, not Pallas
only, but also Appias.c

Cilix, your freedman, I knew but slightly before 3 2
but ever since he delivered me your letter, so full as
it was of affection and kindness, he has himself by his
own words followed up ina wonderful waythe courtesy
with which you wrote. It was a delight to me to
hear him holding forth as he told me all about your
kindly feeling, and the remarks you made about me
day after day. In short, in two days he became my
intimate friend—not so much so, however, that I am
likely to cease missing Phania very much ; and talk-
ing of Phania, when you send him back to Rome,
which I imagine you intend to do very soon, I should
be glad if you would give him instructions as to
everything you wish me to do or look after.

L. Valerius! the lawyer, I strongly recommend to 3
you, and that too even if he is—well, no lawyer.
For I wish to take sounder “ precautionary
measures '⁹ for him than he usually does for others.
Ι am very fond of the man 3 he is of my household,
and one of my most intimate friends. He is unfailing
in his expressions of gratitude to you; but he also
writes that what would carry the greatest weight with
you is a letter from me. I beg of you again and again
not to let him be disappointed in that expectation.
