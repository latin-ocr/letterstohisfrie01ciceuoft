EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, II. xvn.

What do I think about the legions decreed by the 5
Senate for Syria? Well, I rather doubted before
whether they would come; now, if the news that
there is peace in Syria is received in time, I am quite
sure they will not.

As to Marius, the successor to the province, Ι fore-
see that he will arrive late, because the Senate has

I have answered one of your letters, I now come 6
to the second. You beg of me to recommend you
as strongly as possible to Bibulus: I am perfectly
willing to do so, but this seems a good opportunity
for a word or two with you, you are the only man
of all Bibulus's suite who never informed me how
intensely Bibulus disliked me, and that without any
apparent cause. It has been reported to me by
scores of people that when there was great anxiety
at Antioch, and great hopes of me and my army, he
repeatedly declared that he would sooner suffer any
hardship than be thought to have stood in need of
my assistance ; that you were keeping this back about
your own praetor, from a sense of your duty to him
as his quaestor, I did not so much resent, although
I heard from time to time how you were being
treated. But the man himself, when he wrote to
Thermus about the Parthian war, never sent me a
syllable, though he knew perfectly well that it was
Ι who had to bear the brunt of that war. He did
write to me, but only in reference to his son 's augur-
ship3 and I, out of sheer pity, and because I had
always been very friendly with Bibulus, took parti-
cular pains to write to him as courteously as possible.
Now if he is indiscriminately spiteful (and I have 7
'never thought that), I am the less offended as regards
