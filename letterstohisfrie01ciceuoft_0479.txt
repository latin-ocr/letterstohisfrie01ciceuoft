EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. 1v.

sciousness of a right purpose, and that there is no
serious evil other than wrong conduct3 and since
we are so far from it, that our sentiments have ever
been of the soundest, and it is the result of our
policy rather than the policy itself that is the subject
of censure, and since we have fully discharged our
obligations, well then, let us bear what has come to
pass with self-restraint. But, be that as it may, I do
not presume to console you for the troubles common
to all of us ; they indeed require greater inventiveness
in the comforter, and exceptional courage in the
sufferer. But why you should have no special sorrow
of your own, anybody could explain to you easily
enough. For though a certain person has acted with
less despatch than I had expected in relieving you,
I have no doubt at all as to what that person thinks
about your restoration. As to the others, Ι don’t
suppose that you are in any hurry to know my opinion.
There remains the fact that it is painful to you to 3
be so long away from your family 3 it must be a grief
to you, especially to be separated from those boys of
yours, who are the merriest fellows in the world. But,
as Ι wrote to you before, the times are such that
everybody thinks he is worse off than anybody else,
and where each man is, there he least wants to be.
Myself, I consider that we who are at Rome are the
most to be pitied, not only because in the case of
anything that is evil, the sight of it is more painful
than the hearing of it, but also because we are
more exposed to any sudden danger that may arise
than if we were away. Though I must say, speaking
for myself who profess to comfort you, it is not so
much the literature to which I have always devoted
myself, as length of time that has brought me relief.
