EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IV. vn.

might be, or either at Mitylene or in Rhodes. But,
seeing that the power of the man we dread is so
widespread as to have embraced the whole world,
would you not rather reside without danger in your
own house than reside with danger in the house
of another ? For my own part, Ι would sooner be at
home and in my own country, even if it meant my
-facing death, than in any strange and foreign land.
This is what all those feel who are fond of you ; and
as might be expected from your very great and dis-
tinguished merits, their number is great.

Ι am also concerned for your private property, 5
which I should be sorry to see dissipated ; it is true
that it ean suffer no damage likely to be permanent,
for that will not be permitted either by him who
rules the Republic, nor by the Republic itself ; but
apart from that I don’t want to see an assault of
brigands upon your estate. Who these brigands are ,a
I should make bold to tell you now, were I not sure
that you are well aware of them.

At Rome there is, above all others, one man whose 8
anxious efforts, one man whose copious and un-
ceasmg tears are ever interceding for you—your
excellent cousin, C. Marcellus³'; in solicitude and
sorrow I come next, in entreaties I lag behind him,
not having the right of entry, because I stand in need
of intercession myself,⁶ and I have only such influence
as a defeated man may command. But for all that,
in the way of counsel and active devotion I am still
loyal to Marcellus. By the rest of your relatives I

am not called into consultation ; there is nothing 1
am not prepared sor.

⁶ That Cicero had no personal intercourse with Caesar at
this time is evident from iv. 13. 6, and vi. 13. 3.
