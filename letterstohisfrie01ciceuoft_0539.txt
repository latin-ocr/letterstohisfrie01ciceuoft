Rome, January, 45 mc.

As soon as I received your letter from the hand of 1
your freedman Seleucus, I at once sent a note to
Balbus, asking him what was in the law.⁶ His
answer was that while those who were actually in
business as auctioneers were forbidden to be
municipal councillors, those who had retired were
not so forbidden.» So your friends and mine must
be of good heart3 for it would be intolerable if,
when men who were at this moment practising
divination ⁰ were being elected on the Senate at
Rome, men who had at any time practised as
auctioneers should not be allowed to be councillors
in the provincial towns.

There is no news of either of the Spains. It is 2
certain, however, that Pompey α has a large army;
for Caesar himself sent me a copy of Paciaecus's ⁰
dispatch, in which the number of legions there is
stated to be eleven. Messalas also has written to
Quintus Salassus that his brother ⁹ Publius Curtius
was executed by order of Pompey before the eyes of
the army, for having arranged, as was alleged, with
certain Spaniards that, when Pompey had arrived
at some town or other to negotiate for supplies,
they should arrest him and take him to Caesar.

⁴ Gnaeus. the elder son of Pompey the Great.

‘ L. Iunius Paciaecus is mentioned in De bello Hispani-
ensi as a distinguished and capable man, a native of Spain,
whom Caesar sent to relieve Utica when besieged by Pompey.

t M. Valerius Messala, consul in 52 mc.

¹ eze„ Q. Salassus's brother.
