EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, Ι. 1x.

you are to me, and that I mean not only to impress.
that fact upon yourself, but also to ensure its re-
cognition by everybody in the world, yes, and by
all generations to come. ,

Appius has now made a public declaration in the 25
Senate of what he used ostento assert before in
private conversation, ‘⁶ that if he were allowed to
get a law through the comitia curiata he would
cast lots with his colleague for their respective
provinces, but that if no such law were passed, he
would come to an arrangement with his colleague
and become your successor in Cilicia3 that the
passing of such a law in the comitia curiata,
while formally important for a consul, is not in-
dispensable; and that holding the province as he
did by a decree of the Senate, he would hold im-
perium also under the law os Sulla, until such
time as he entered the city.’'‘¹ What your several
friends and relations write to you about it respec-
tively Ι cannot tell ; Ι only know that opinions differ.
There is a certain section who think you would be
within your rights in not resigning your province,
because, as they say, your successor’s appointment
lacks the sanction of a law passed in the comitia
curiata. There are others, too, who think that, if
you do retire, you can leave behind you a representa-
tive in charge of the province.

I am myself not so sure of the legal point (though
that is not so very doubtful either), as I am of this,

that it is due to your exalted position, y‘our dignity‚
and your kindness (the exercise of w ich Ι know

is a great and constant satisfaction to you), to

provision which has its potentialities.” And Cicero evidently
thinks that Appius would be legally Justified.
