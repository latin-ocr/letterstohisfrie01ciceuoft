EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, III. xm(

only by the weight of your public speeches and your
voting in the Senate (quite enough for me, considering
it was you), but also by your active assistance and your
advice, by coming to my house and by interviewing
my people, you left no act of courtesy for anybody
else to do. Now all these efforts of yours are of far
greater importance in my eyes than even the object
you had in making them. For though the badges
of virtue have been won by many a man who has no
virtue in him, such sincere devotion on the part of
such men as yourself can be won by virtue alone.
What I therefore promise myself as the fruit of 2

our friendship is that friendship itself, and nothing
can be more richly fertile than that, especially in
those pursuits to which we are both of us deeply
attached. I avow myself both your partner in
po‘lities, as to which our opinions coincide, and your
comrade in every-day life, closely bound to· you by
the arts and studies we cultivate in common. I
could have wished that it had so chanced that you
could esteem my family as highly as I esteem every
member of yours. And yet some sort of psychic
prescience bids me not despair of even that.“ But
that has nothing to do with you 3 the responsibility
lies on me. I should like you to be assured of this,
and you will come to see it in time, that by this
domestic revolution b a substantial addition has been
made to my sincere regard for you (though no addi-
tion seemed possible) rather than that it has been
in the slightest degree impaired. As I write this I
hope you are already censor. My letter is so much
the shorter, and, as it has to meet the eye of a master
of morals,⁶ more modest.
