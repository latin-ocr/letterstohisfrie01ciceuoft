EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IV. η.

Υοιι ask me what plan I have 3 well, it is the sort 2
of plan that Ι could more easily adopt myself than
recommend to another. For what poliey is there
that I could venture to press upon a man of your
exceptional influence and consummate sagacity ?
If we are asking what is the most right and proper

that ls being done and all that has already been done,
but also what the trend of affairs is, and what is
likely to be the issue. One is therefore obliged
either to approve the measures now being taken, or

is nothing else to consider but what is my plan when
I do go, and what my destination. Look at it as
you will, no more wretched state of things has ever
occurred, n0, nor any problem harder to solve. For no
