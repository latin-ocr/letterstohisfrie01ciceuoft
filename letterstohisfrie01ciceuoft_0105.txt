EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, I. rx.

sentiments, confirmed by my consulship, afterwards
occasionally obscured, utterly suppressed before
your consulship, but revived by you, have now
been entirely renounced by those who should
have fostered them3 and that it is so, those who in
the old days of our power were entitled optimates
not only clearly show by their‘ bearing and looks,
whereby it is very easy to keep up a pretence, but
have furthermore often impressed it upon us by
their actual votes both in the Senate and on the
bench.

And so it follows that among wise citizens——
and a wise citizen is what Ι wish both to be and to

have e credit of being—there ought to be a
Qpse‘ssle change both of opinion and purpose. For
that same Plato, whose teaching Ι earnestly en-
deavour to follow, gives us this injunction—“ to
assert yourself in politics only so far as you can
jus-tify your measures to your fellow-citizens 3 for it
is as wrong to use violence to your country as to qne
of* your parents.”‘² And indeed he declares that
*the reason why he did not take part in public affairs
was that, finding the people of Athens now almost
in a state of dotage,²' and seeing that they could
be ruled neither by argument nor by anything but
force, while he despaired of their being persuaded,
he did not deem it lawful that they should be forced.

My own position was different, inasmuch as my
people were not in their dotage, and not being free
to choose whether I should engage in politics or not,
my hands were tied3 but I rejoiced none the less
that in one ¹and the same cause ⁰ it was allowed me
to defend a policy at once advantageous to myself
and right in the judgement of any honest man.
