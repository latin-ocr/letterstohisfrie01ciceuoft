EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, ΙΙ. xv.—xv1.

applauld this decision of mine, for it cannot be
a tere .

What you wrote to me about Ocella is not as 5
intelligible as it should be 3 and it does not appear
in the Gema-eff Your exploits are so celebrated
that the affair of Matrinius has been heard of even
on the other side of Mount Taurus. If I am not
delayed at all by the Etesian Winds‚b I shall see
you, Ι hope, pretty soon.

Μ. Τ. CICERO, 1MPERATOR, ΤΟ THE SAME

Cumae, early in May, 49 13.c.⁶

I should have been deeply grieved at your letter 1
had not my own reflection by this time stifled all
sense of irritation, and had not I so long despaired
of affairs that my mind had grown callous to any
fresh grief. Why it should have happened, how-
ever, that my former letter should lead you to
suspect what you mention in yours, I fail to see.
What did that letter contain beyond a complaint
of the times, which keep my mind on the rank, but
no more so than yours? My experience of your
acute intellect is not such that I could ever suppose
you do not see all that I see myself. What surprises
me is that you, who ought to know my inmost heart,
could ever have been induced to regard me as either
so short-sighted as to desert a cause exalted to such
a height for one that is tottering and all but prostrate,
or so inconsistent as to forfeit in a moment all the
favour Ι had accumulated in the eyes of one now
