EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IV. x1v.

Now you congratulate me upon the step I have 3
taken ;α well, I am quite sure you mean it ; but I
assure you that in these unhappy days Ι should not
have made any change in my life had I not found
on my return, that my domestic affairs were in no
less evil plight than those of the state. For when
those very persons in whose eyes my welfare and all
I possessed should have been most proeious, con-
sidering the imperishable benefits I had bestowed
upon them, had behaved so wickedly that I could
find no safety within the walls of my own house,
no corner of it without its ambush,-—then Ι thought
it about time to protect myself by new and trust-
worthy alliances against the treachery of the old.
But enough, or even too much, about my own affairs.

As to yours, Ι should be glad to see you no more 4
anxious than you ought to be, in other words, not
imagining that you have anything special to sear. If
there is to be any sound basis of any constitution of
whatever nature, Ι can see that you will be free of
all danger3 for I take it that you have already
appeased one party, while the other has never been
angry with you. But as regards my own wishes for
your welfare, I should like you to assure yourself,
that for my part whatever steps I may find it neces-
sary to take, though I am quite aware what my
position is and how little Ι can do at the present
juncture, I shall none the less be at hand to support
your interests, your reputation, and your restoration
by my efforts and advice, and, at any rate, you may
be sure, by my eagerness to serve you. I should be
glad if you, on your part, would take every care to
let me know both what you are doing, and what you
think you are likely to do. Farewell.
