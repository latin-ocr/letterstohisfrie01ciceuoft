M. Τ. CICERO, 1MPERATOR, ΤΟ THE SAME

Laodicea, early in May‚⁰ 50 mc.

The letters Ι get from you arefew and far between 1

(perhaps they do not reach me), but they are
charming3 to take only the last I got, how shrewd
it waS, how packed· with kindness and good advice Ξ
Though I had already decided that Ι should have
to aet in every respect as you advise, I am none the
less fortified in my intentions by the feeling that
men of discernment and my faithful counsellors hold
the same views.

For Appius? as Ι have often remarked in my
conversations with you, I have a profound regard‚
and as soon as we buried the hatchet Ι felt that I
had begun to win his regard. When consul he was
prompt to do me honour, as a friend he is charming,
and he takes an interest in what interests me. T hat
Lon the other hand, never failed in my good services
to him, you yourself can testify 3 and now I think Ι
have the added testimony of Phania,⁰ turning up
like the witness in the de'nouement of a comedy ‘²3
and, ‘on my honour, I thought all the more highly
of him because I felt that he was devoted to you.
You know that I am now all for Pompey, and you
understand that I am fond of Brutus. What reason
is there why it should not be one of my particular
desires to take to my heart one so illustriously
blessed with youth, affluence, public honours,e
ability, children! relatives, connexions, and friends,

Ι Of his three daughters, the eldest married Pompey's eldest
son, the second Brutus, and the third Cornelius Lentulus.
