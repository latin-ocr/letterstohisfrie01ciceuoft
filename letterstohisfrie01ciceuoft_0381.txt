EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. vu.
VII

TO CN. POMPEIUS MAGNUS, IN ASIA
Rome, about June, 62 n.c.

If you and t'he army are in good health‚ it 1
is well; I, too, am in good health.‘² Your official
dispatch gave me, in common with everybody else,
more pleasure than you could believe. For you
indicate in it as confident a hope of peace as I have
consistently held out to all others, because Ι relied
exclusively upon you ; though I must tell you that
your enemies os long standing (your friends of
recent date) are profoundly dismayed at your
dispatch3 they have been hurled down from the
height of their expectations‚ and lie prostrate.

As regards your private letter to me, however, in 2
spite of its containing but a slight expression of your
regard for me, I assure you I was charmed with it ;
for generally speaking nothing cheers me up so
much as the consciousness of my good services to
others3 and if, as sometimes happens, they elicit no
adequate response, I am quite content that the
balance of services rendered should rest with me.
Of this I have no doubt at all that, if the proofs of
my deep devotion to you have not quite succeeded in
attaching me to you, that attachment will be brought
about and cemented between us by the interests of
the state.

Stssl, not to leave you in any doubt as to what it was 3
Ι missed in your letter, I shall be as frank with you
in mine as my own nature and our mutual friend-
ship alike demand. My achievements have been
such that I did expect some congratulatory reference
