EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, ΙΙΙ. x.-x1.

remarks about me. Since his son then is your son-
in- law, and since, over and above this connexion by
marriage, I know how dear and how delightful a
companion you are to Cn. Pompeius, Ι ask you, what
is my feeling towards you bound to be. Ρ Especially
when he has written me such a letter that, had I
been your enemy and not your devoted friend, Ι
should have been propitiated by it, and submitted
myself unreservedly to the wishes, yes, even to the
nod, of one who had deserved so well of me.

But no more on these topics; perhaps I have ll
already dealt with them at unnecessary length. Now
let me tell you what schemes Ι have started and put
on a sound footingss . . . And all this that I am
doing, and intend to do, is in defenee of your high
position rather than to secure your personal safety.
For Ι hope to hear at an early date that you have
been elected censor ; well, the duties of that magis-
tracy demand very high courage and very sound
judgement, and Ι am of opinion that you would do
well to give more earnest and careful consideration
to those duties than you do to my activities in your
interest.

M. menno 'ro APPIUS PULCHER, CENSOR (I hope)
In camp on the Pyramus‚¹’ June, 50 B.c.

While in camp on the river Pyramus, I have had two l
letters from you delivered to me at the same time,
which Q. Servilius had sent me from Tarsus. In one
of them the date given was April 5 ; the other, which
Ι gathered to be the later of the two, was undated.
