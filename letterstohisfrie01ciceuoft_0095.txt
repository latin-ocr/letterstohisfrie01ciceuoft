EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, I. ix.

think Ι had any reason to dread very much the impu-
tation of inconsistency if in the expression of some of
my opinions Ι made a slight change in my political
attitude, and cffitributed my moral support to the

his to Pompey. Moreover, in a matter affecting the
state, I could not but mark the inspired words in

5th⁶ to find so much spirit, or shall I say authority in

that body. I remembered also that when .I2 had
retired from office, up to the consulship ⁶ of Caesar
