EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. xvx.

idea that. any evil, as you suppose, ean have be-
fallen those you loved, it means a very material
abatement of your grief. For then there will only
be left you that exclusive feeling of personal sorrow,
in which they can have no share, but which begins
and ends with yourself alone. ’ But surely, in regard
to that, it no longer becomes the moral dignity and
wisdom you have exhibited from your boyhood, to be
inordinately impatient of the troubles that have
befallen yourself, when they have no connexion
whatever with any misery or evil that may have
befallen those to whom you were so devoted. The
fact is that you have ever proved yourself, both in
private and in public life, to be such that you are
’ bound to maintain your high character, and obey
the dictates of consistency. For whatever allevia-
tion the lapse of time of itself is bound to bring us,
obliterating in its course the most deep—seated of
sorrows, that, I say, it is our duty by wisdom and
foresight to forestall.

And again, if there never was a woman, when
bereft of her children, so feeble in character as not,
sooner or later, to make an end of her mourning,
surely we men ought to anticipate by our wisdom
what the passage of days is sure to bring us, and not
to wait for time to apply the remedy which reason
enables us to apply at this very moment.

If this letter of mine has done you any good, Ι feel
that Ι have aehieved something that Ι had at heart 3
but if by any chance it has not the desired effect, I
still feel that I have played the part of a very sincere
well-wisher and friend3 and that is what I should
like you to believe I have always been to you, and to
rest assured that I shall continue to be.
