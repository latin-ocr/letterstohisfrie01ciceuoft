EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, II. xl.—xl1.

About the panthers,<¹ the business is being carefully 2
attended to according to my orders with the aid
of those who hunt them regularly ¹²3 but it is
surprising how few panthers there are ; and they tell
me that those there are7bitterly complain that in my
province no snares are s‘et for ‚any living creature
but themselves3 and so they have decided, it is
said, to emigrate from .this province into Caria.
Still my people are busy in the matter, and nobody
more so than Patiscus. All the animals caught
will be at your service ; but how many there are, Ι
have no idea. Your aedileship, Ι do assure you, is
of intense interest to me; this day itself *reminds
me of it, for I write this on the very day of the
Megalensia.⁶ .

I should like you to spare no pains in writing to 3
me fully about the whole political situation3 for
I shall regard the information you give me as the
most trustworthy.

news as yet of what followed ; but nothing distresses
me more than that amid all these worries, if there is
anything to laugh at, Ι do not share the joke with
you. Of course there are many things to laugh at,
but I dare not commit them to paper. What
worries me is that so far I have nothing in the way
