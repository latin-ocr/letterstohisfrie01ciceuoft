EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. vnn-xx.

all'I 'promise you, and pledge myself to do. I under-
took the defence of your high position in your absence,
and in that defence I mean to persevere, no longer
for the sake of our friendship alone, but now also
for the sake of my consistency.

Ι therefore thought it enough for the present to
write to you Just this—that, if I saw myself that
there was anything to be done in furtherance of your
wishes or interests or advancement, I should do it
on my own initiative 3 but if I received any hint from
yourself or your friends, I should not fail to convince
you that neither have you ever written, nor any of
your friends suggested, anything to me that went
unheeded. I should like you, therefore, to write to
me on all subjeets‚ great, small, or indifferent, as to
a most intimate friend3 and, moreover, to instruct
your people so to avail themselves of my industry,
counsel‚ authority, and influence in all business affairs,
public or private, forensic or domestic, affecting
yourself or your friends, your visitors or clients, that,
so far as is possible, in such labour my yearning for
your presence may find alleviation.
