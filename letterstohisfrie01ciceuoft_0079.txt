EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, Ι. vm.

the fault of those who have estranged from the
senate both an order that was most closely bound to
it ‘¹ and a highly distinguished person.

But—to return to what more nearly concerns your 5
affairs—I have ascertained that you have a sincere
friend in Pompey, and with him as consul, so far as Ι
can see, you will secure all you-want3 in all those
matters he will find in me a firm adherent, and nothing
which affects you will be overlooked3 nor shall I
be afraid os his thinking me troublesome‚ for when
he sees how grateful I am, he will be pleased on his
own account.

Ι should like you to assure yourself that there is 6
not a single thing which affects you, even the most

can satisfy myself on the score of assiduity, but
in practical results Ι fail to satisfy myself, because,
I do not say my repaying, but even imagining
myself repaying, any portion of your services is
beyond my power.

It is rumoured that you have achieved a great 7
success ; ὓ your letter, about which Ι have already
had a conversation with Pompey, is eagerly awaited.
When it has arrived Ι shall be conspicuously energetic
in interviewing the magistrates and senators 3 and in
all else which affects you, though my efforts may
prove beyond my capacity, Ι shall still be doing less
than I ought to do.

the title of imperator.
