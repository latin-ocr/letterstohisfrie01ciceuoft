EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. 1x.

in P. Vatinius, who desires the formal pleading of a
case on his behalf. You will not, Ι take it, refuse
the defence of a man when in office, whose defence
you undertook when he was in danger. Resides,
from my point of view, whom should I rather select
and call to my aid than the man whose defence
taught me the secret of success ? And surely I need
not fear that the man who turned his back upon a
coalition of the most powerful men in Rome to fight
for my political status will not overpower and crush
the slanderous jealousies of a pack of contemptible
marplots. So if you love me as much as ever, take
up my case without reserve, and consider that you
should accept and shoulder whatever burden of
service it may be that the defence of my prestige
involves. You know that my good fortune in some
strange way finds plenty of detractors, though Ι
swear I don't deserve it ; but what does that matter,
if, do what I will, it is somehow my fate to find it so ?
Should it happen then, by any chance, that there is
anybody who wants to prejudice my claims,‘² I beg
of you not to abate your customary generosity in
defending me in my absence. I have transcribed
you below my despatch to the Senate on my achieve-
ments ; it is an exact copy of what I sent.

They tell me that your slave? your reader who
ran away, has joined the Vardaei ; you gave me no
instructions about him, but I have, nevertheless,
issued a provisionary warrant for his pursuit by land
and sea, and Ι am sure 1 shall find him for you,
unless he has escaped to Dalmatia ; still I shall rout
him out even from there sooner or later. Whatever
you do, remain my friend. Farewell.
