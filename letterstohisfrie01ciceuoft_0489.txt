EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. vl.

feet had driven me into exile, I remember being
told by several visitors who came to see me on their
way from Asia, where you then were, that you
spoke confidently of my early and glorious return.

ι If you have not been misled by a certain scientific 3
system of Etruscan lore ⁰ bequeathed you by your
illustrious and excellent father, neither shall Ι be
misled by my own skill in divination, which I have

as you yourself know, of their teaching, but also
from a wide experience in dealing with public affairs,
and the many vicissitudes of my politica] life.

And I have the more confidence in this divination 4
because, difficult to interpret and distracted as these
times have been, it has never once in the slightest

Caesar, I afterwards warned him not to break with
him. I saw that the coalition meant the erushing
of the Senate's power, and a rupture the stirring
up of a civil war. Moreover, I was on the most
intimate terms with Caesar, while Ι had the highest
esteem for Pompey ; but my advice, without being
disloyal to the latter, was beneficial to both.

Of other instances of my foresight I say nothing 3 5
for I should be sorry that Caesar, who has deserved
