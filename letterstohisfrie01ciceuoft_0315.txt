EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IV. v1.'—vn.

whereas in those days when depressed by the ills of
the state, I had a house to welcome me where Ι
could be comforted, now, depressed as I may be, I
cannot flee from my house and take refuge in the
state, to find repose in her prosperity. And so I

date. Nothing could afford me greater relies than
the renewal of our intimacy and conversations 3 and

discuss together beforehand what must be our line
of conduct, in passing through this period during
which we must adapt ourselves unreservedly to the
inclinations of one man, but one who is not only far-
sighted but liberal and (as I think I have assured
myself) no enemy to me and a sincere friend to you.
But though that is so, it is still a matter for serious
deliberation what line we should take, not in the way
of public action, but of leading, by his gracious
permission, a quiet life.
