EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, Ι. 1.

sentative‚ makes no secret of countering us by means
of bribery ; the business is being managed with the
aid of those very financiers who advanced the money >
for it when you were in Rome. Any—-and they are
but few—who are well disposed to the king, are
unanimous in wishing that the matter should be put
in Pompey’s hands, while the. Senate accepts the
fictitious plea of religious scruples, not for any
reason of religion, but it is jealous of Pompey, and
disgusted at the king’s lavish bribery.

As regards Pompey, Ι never cease urging and im- 2
ploring him——nay even frankly rebuking him, and
warning him, not to incur a storm of public obloquy ;
but he has left absolutely no room for any entreaties
or admonitions of mine ; both in his ordinary con-
versation, and publicly in the Senate he has advocated
your cause with as much eloquence, earnestness,
enthusiasm, and energy as anybody could possibly
have done, while testifying at the same time in the
highest terms to your good offiees towards him and
his own affection for you. Marcellinus,a you are
aware, is angry with you ’; in all else, however, if
you except this affair of the king, he makes us think
that he will support you right gallantly. We accept
what he offers ; but as to his determination to bring
the religious question before the Senate (and indeed
he has repeatedly done so), nothing can induce him to

ive it up.
g What has happened up to the 13th of J anuary (Ι am 3
writing in the early morning of that day) is this:
Hortensius, Lucullus, and I are in favour of yielding to
the religious objections as regards the army ; for in no
other way could our object be attained ; but accord-
ing to the decree already passed on your own motion,
