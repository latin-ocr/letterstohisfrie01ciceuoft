EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. xv.

intimacy, the same tastes—-what bond is lacking, Ι
ask you, to make our union complete ? Can we not
then be together? For the life of me Ι cannot see
what is to prevent it. But as a matter of fact we
have not been so, though we were neighbours in
the country at Tusculum and. Puteoli3 I need not
say in Rome, where the forum is a meeting-place for
all, so that propinquity of residence is of no account.

But by some evil chance or other our age is con· 3
fronted with conditions which, at the very moment
when I ought to have been more than ever prosperous,
make me actually ashamed of being alive. What
possible sanctuary is left to me, despoiled as I am of
all that might have graced and comforted both my
private and public life ? Literary work, Ι presume ;
and indeed it is that which I find an unfailing resource3
for what else is there for me to do ? But even litera-
ture itself seems somehow or other to shut me out o'f
any haven of refuge, and to cast it in my teeth that I
cleave to a life which promises nothing but the pro-
longation of a period of utter misery.

Such being the situation, can you wonder at my 4
absenting myself from a city where Ι can find no
pleasure in my home, and where I utterly loathe the
life one leads, the men one meets, the bar and the
senate-house? Accordingly I resort to literary work
on which I spend all my time--not to get out of it
a lasting cure, but some little forgetfulness of my
sorrow.

But had you and Ι done what, owing to our daily 5
apprehension, it never so much as occurred to us to do,
we should have been together all the time, and I
should have found your ill-health ‘² no more of an
objection than you would my melancholy brooding.
