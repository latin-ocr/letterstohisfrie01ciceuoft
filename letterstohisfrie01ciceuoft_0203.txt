EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, III. 11.

II

TO THE SAME‚ WHEN PROCONSUL IN c1L1c1A

Rome, 51 ιω.

Though it has come about both against my inclina*- 1
tions and contrary to my expectations that Ι am
obliged to set out for a province with imperium,‘⁸
amid my many and varied annoyances and reflections
the one consolation that suggests itself to me is, that
you could have no better friend than Ι am as your
successor, and that Ι could take over the province
from nobody who would be more anxious to hand it
over to me in the best possible order and with all
difficulties smoothed away. And if you, too, have the

ι same hope as regards my goodwill towards you, you
will assuredly never be disappointed in that hope.
I beg and beseech you again and again with the
greatest earnestness, in the name of our very close
connexion? and of your own incomparable kindliness,
in whatever respect you can (and you can in very
many respects) to look ahead and take measures for
the protection of my interests.

You see that by a decree of the Senate I am 2
obliged to take a province.⁰ If, so far as you find it
feasible in the circumstancesfl you hand it over to
me as unencumbered with difficulties as you can, it
will be the easier for me to run the whole race (if I
order of seniority) accept such appointments; and Cicero was
thus, twelve years after his consulship, compelled to draw
lots for a consular province: he drew Cilicia, and his col-
league in the consulship, Bibulus, soon after obtained Syria.
