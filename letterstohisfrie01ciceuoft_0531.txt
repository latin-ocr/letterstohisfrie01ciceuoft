EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. xm.

has been unusually difficult to approach him 3 and just
now, as the African disaffectionss has roused his
particular indignation‚ Ι fancy he is inclined to
keep on tenterhooks for a longer spell those who
he thinks have given him a longer spell of trouble
and annoyance. But even in regard to this we find
him to be daily more yielding and conciliatory.
You must therefore take my word for it, and make a
mental note of it, that Ι have given you this specific
assurance, that the painful position you are in will
not last much longer.

Now that you have my candid opinion, what my 4
wishes are in your interests will appear from what I
do rather than from what Ι say. Had I as much
power as I ought to have in a state of which I have
deserved as well as you, at any rate, consider I have,
neither would you be so unfortunately situated as
you are3 for my ascendancy has been destroyed,
and your welfare jeopardized‚ by one and the same
cause. But for all that, so far as the shadow of
my former position, so far as the little that is left
of my popularity avasss, my zeal and counsel, my
efforts, influence‚ and loyalty will invariably be at the
disposal of your excellent brothers. ’

See to it that you on your part maintain that 5
spirit of courage you have always maintained,
firstly for the reason I have given you3 secondly
because your politica] aspirations and sentiments have
always been such as not only to justify your looking
forward to a prosperous future, but also, if your
future were in all respects the reverse, to make it
your duty, conscious as you are of all you have done

and purposed to do, to face every eventuality with
a high and heroic spirit.
