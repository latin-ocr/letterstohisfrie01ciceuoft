CICERO'S LETTERS TO HIS FRIENDS
BOOK VI
I

emeno 'ro Α. TonQuATus α

Rome, January, 45 ιο.

Amnouon the universal confusion of affairs is such l
Ι that every man complains of his own lot as being
worse than any other, and there is not a man who
would not rather be anywhere else in the world than
where he is, still Ι have no doubt that the worst
form of misery at the present time for an honest
citizen is to be at Rome. For although, wherever a
man is, he has the same feeling of exasperation at
the ruin both of the public and of his private interests,
still his eyes intensify his grief, being compelled to see
what others only hear, and forbidding any distraction
of his thoughts from his woes. Accordingly, though
you cannot but be distressed by the thought of all
you have lost, you must at any rate rid your mind of
that special sorrow which I am told afflicts you most
-the fact of your not being at Rome. For great as
is your annoyance at being cut off from your family

warmly attached to myself.'' The following letters to him
are almost wholly of a philosophical character.
