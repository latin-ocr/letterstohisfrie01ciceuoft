§L Though allowed to remain in Italy when all

happy; he had broken with his brother Quintus,
and Terentia (he alleged) had mismanaged his finan*
cial affairs in his absence ; while Dolabella, his son-
111- law, was so notoriously unfaithful to Tullia as to
make a divorce inevitable.

§Q He was consoled, however, by a reassuring
letter from Caesar in Egypt, who permitted him to
retain his lictors and the title of imperatam on
Caesar’ 3 return Cicero met him and was cord’ially
received, and being given leave to live wherever he
liked, he chose Tusculum, so as to be near Rome.

Trebellius, and the ensuing riots had to be quelled
