EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. xa.

ΧΑ

THE SAME TO HIS DEAR CICERO
Narona, end of J anuary, 44 ιω.

If you are in good health, it is well ; I, too, am in 1
good health. So far I have ferreted out nothing
about your Dionysius ⁰ ; and I am the less likely to do
so since the cold of Dalmatia which drove me thence
has again frozen me up here. I shall not stop, how-
ever, until I rout him out some time or other. But
you are setting me all sorts of hard tasks. You
wrote me some rigmarole of an intercession, and a
very earnest one it was, on behalf of Catilius.⁶ Then
there's our friend Sextus Servilius,⁶—-a plague upon
you both ! for I swear I am as fond of him as you are.
But are these the kind of clientS, these the kind of
cases you gentlemen undertake to defend? A man
like Catilius, the most bloodthirsty ruffian alive, who
has murdered, roughly handled, utterly ruined so
many free-born folk‚ mothers of families, Roman
citizens, and devastated whole districts? The ape
-I wouldn't give a groat for the fellow d—took up
arms against me, so I made him a prisoner of war.

But when all is said and done, my dear Cicero, 2
what can I do ? On my oath, I am anxious to carry
out your commands to the letter, and I remit and
cancel at your request the punishment—it was of a
corpora] nature—I had intended inflicting upon him
if ever Ι got hold of him. But what answer can Ι
give those who demand legal reparation for the
pillage of their property, the capture of their ships,
the murder of their brothers, children, and parents ?
