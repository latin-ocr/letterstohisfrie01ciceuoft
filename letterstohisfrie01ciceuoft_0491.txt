EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. vr

so well of me,·should be under the impression- that
I. gave such advice to Pompey, that, had he followed
it,Caesar, while he would no doubt be distinguished in
civil life and a leading man in the state‚“ would not
have the extraordinary power he now has. Ι ex-
pressed the opinion that Pompey ought to go to Spain;
and had he done so, there would have been no civil
war at all. As to recognizing the candidature of an
absentee,¹' I did not fight so much for making it a
legal precedent, as for having it recognized because
thepeople had insisted upon it at the urgent instance
of the consul himself.

ι There arose a pretext for war. What opportunity
of either warning or remonstrating did Ι ever let
slip, feeling as I did that a peace even on the most
unfavourable terms was preferable to the most
righteous of wars ? My counsel was over-ruled, not 6
so much by Pompey, for he was impressed by it, but
by those who relied on Pompey's leadership, and
imagined that a victory in that war would exactly
suit their private interests and their greed. The war
was begun ; Ι took no part in it ; it was driven away
from the shores of Italy,⁶ where I remained as long
as Ι possibly could. But my sense of honour weighed
more with me than my fears. I shrank from failing
Pompey in his hour of need, considering that on a
former occasion he had not failed me in mine. And
80, yielding perforce to my sense of duty, or my
fear of what g'ood citizens would say, or the prompt-
ings of honour (call it what you please), like Amphi-
araus in the plays‚d Ι too, not blindly but knowingly‚
set forth for ‘⁴ the field of ruin spread before my
eyes.” And in this war no disaster has happened
without my foretelling it.
