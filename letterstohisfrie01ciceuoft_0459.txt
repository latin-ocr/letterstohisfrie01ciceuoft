EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. xxl.

we ought to have thought lightly of death, on the
grounds that it was not likely to retain any sensa-
tion, afflicted as we now are, we ought not merely
to think lightly of it, but even to pray for it.

On your part, as you love me, make the best of ὅ
that leisure of yours, and convince yourself that,
apart from wrong and blameworthy conduct, of
which you have always been and will be innocent,
nothing can befall a man which is horrible or greatly
to be feared 3 on my part, if I think it possible and
proper, Ι shall come and see you soon ; if anything
happens to make a change of plan necessary, I shall
inform you at once. Don’t let your desire to see me
stir you in your poor state of health from where you
are, until you have inquired of me by letter what Ι
wish you to do. I should be glad if you would main-
tain your regard for me, as indeed you do, and care-
fully study your health and peace of mind.
