EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, ΙΙΙ. v.

ing to me, it naturally follows that I should like you
to think that it will be, and already is, an urgent
charge upon me to see to it that, in the first place
you and all your people, and secondly the rest of the
world also, may be able to recognize that I am most
friendly disposed towards you⁴; and it seems to me
that those who are still not fully convinced of it, do
not so much fail to understand the fact as object to
our being on such friendly terms. But understand
it they assuredly will ε for neither will the characters
be insignificant, nor the motives mean in the drama
that is to be enacted. But I wish the performance
of all this to be better than what Ι say or write.
My itinerary seems to have caused you consider- 3

able doubt as to whether you will see me in the
province 3 well, this is how the matter stands. When
I spoke with your freedman Phania at Brundisium,
I came to a point in the conversation when I said
that I would willingly come first to that part of the
province to which I thought you were most anxious “
that I should come. Then he told me, that since you
desired to quit the province on board a fleet, it would
be extremely convenient to you if I put in to Sida‚⁰
a sea-board part of the province, with my ships. I
said I would do so, and I should have done so, had
not our friend L. Clodius told me at Corcyra that
that was the very last thing I should do ; that you
would be at Laodicea to meet me on my arrival.
That meant a much shorter journey and was much
more convenient for me, especially as I thought you

preferred it so. -
After that your plans were completely altered. 4

As things now stand, it will be easiest for you to
decide what can be done; what I propose to do
