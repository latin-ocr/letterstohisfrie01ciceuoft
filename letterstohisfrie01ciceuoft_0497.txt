EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. vr.

of government‚ whether it remains as it is or whether
it is changed, ever suffer—in the first place that all
men equally implicated should not be treated alike
in regard to position and property3 and secondly,
that honourable men and good citizens with no
brand of infamy upon them should not return to that
state to which so many convicted of heinous crimes
have already returned.

There is my augury for you! And had I the 12
slightest doubt about it, I should not put it forward
in preference to those consolatory reflections with
which I' should easily reassure a man of spirit3 I
mean that, had you taken up arms in defenee of the
Republic--for that is what you then thought—with
the certain hope of victory, you deserved no par-
ticular credit3 if, however, considering the un-
certainty of the issues and consequences of wars,
you had considered the possible contingency of our
defeat, then it is not right of yon, while you were
perfectly prepared to enjoy success, to be now so
entirely incapable of facing failure. I should also
press this point—how much comfort you ought to
find in the consciousness of all you have done, and
how much pleasure to soothe your sorrows in your
literary pursuits. I should dwell on the heavy dis-
asters that have befallen not only men of old, but
also these men of recent times‚your own commanders,
'if they were not your eomrades ; I should quote the
name of many an illustrious foreigner too. For our
grief is assuaged when we remind ourselves of what
we may eall the universal law and the conditions of
human life.

Ι should also give you a description of our life in 13
Rome—the utter chaos and confusion of it all!
