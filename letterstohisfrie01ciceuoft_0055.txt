EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, Ι. v.—vb.

pressed‚ there is a third option, which neither Selicius⁶
nor Ι were disposed to reject, and that is that we
should neither permit the cause of the king to lan-
guish, nor, in defiance of our resistance‚ to be put in
the hands of one to whom it is thought to have been
already practically assigned?

In all I do I shall be very careful to arrange that
we shall not fail to make a struggle for whatever
position can be held, while if there be any position
we have found untenable, we shall avoid the appear-
ance of defeat.

Wise and high-minded as you are, you will not 4
forget that the foundations of all your greatness and
distinction are your personal worth, your aehieve-
ments, and the solidity of your character3 and that
if the gifts which fortune has bestowed upon you
suffer any diminution through the treachery of a few
individuals, it will do more harm to them than to
you. In thought or deed I miss no opportunity of pro-
moting your interests, and in whatever I do, I avail
myself of the services of Q. Selicius, and in my
opinion there is no one of your friends who has more
common sense, integrity, or affection for yourself.
