EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, ΙΙΙ. x.

To THE SAME

Laodicea, early in May, 50 1³.c.

When news was brought me of the reckless be· 1
haviour of those who were making trouble for you,‘¹
the first announcement of it seriously disturbed me,
since nothing could have happened to cause me
greater surprise ; when I had pulled myself together,
however, it seemed to me that the subsequent situa-
tion could be very easily dealt with, because I had
absolute confidence in yourself, and a good deal in
your friends, and many considerations occurred to
me to justify my expectation that all this distress of
yours would actually redound to your honour. What
caused me profound annoyance, was that by this
measure of theirs, those who are jealous of you, had
robbed you, as I could see, of a very sure and well-
deserved triumph. But if you attach no more im-
portance to the matter than I have always been
convinced should be attached to it, you will be acting
wisely, and, with the victory on your side, will enjoy
in the vexation of your enemies the most well-
deserved of triumphs. For I clearly foresee, that you,
with all your energy, resources‚ and wisdom‚will make
your enemies bitterly regret their foolhardiness. As
regards myself, I call the gods of heaven to witness
this my promise and assurance to you, that in the

Smyrna murdered Trebonius, roconsul of Asia. He was
declared a public enemy an Cassius besieged him in
Laodicea, where, to avoid falling into the hands of his
enemies, he ordered one of his own soldiers to kill him.
