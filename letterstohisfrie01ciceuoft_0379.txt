EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. v1.

of the plebs, and all the others to whom you had
written, to believe me rather than your letters.
Anyhow the whole business has been postponed till
the mouth of January, but we find no difficulty in
holding our own.

Roused by your congratulations-—for you wrote to 2
me some time ago, wishing me luck on having bought
a house from Crassus—1 have now bought that very
house for three thousand five hundred sestertia,⁰ a
considerable time after you congratulated me on
having done so. The consequence is that I must
tell you Ι am so heavily in debt, that I am eager
to join a conspiracy, if anybody would let me in;
but while some exclude me because they hate me,
and indeed make no secret of their hatred of the man
who crushed the other conspiracy? others distrust
me and fear that I am trying to circumvent them,
and do not believe that one who has released the
money-lenders from a blockade can possibly be short
of money. As a matter of fact there is' plenty of
money to be got at six per cent. Speaking for
myself, my achievements have secured me one
advantage—I am looked upon as ‘⁶ a good namest ”

Ι have inspected your own house, too, and its 3
whole design, and it has pleased me very much.

As for Antonius,c though everybody remarks the 4
cessation of his services to me, it did not prevent my
defending him in the Senate with much earnestness
and assiduity‚ and I greatly impressed the Senate
with my address and the weight of my personality.

I should be glad if you would write to me more 5
frequently.
