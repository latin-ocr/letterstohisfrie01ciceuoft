CICERO'S LETTERS· TO HIS FRIENDS

BOOK IV Α
Ι

Μ. CICERO TO SERVIUS SULPICIUS RUFUS α Ι
Cumae, towards the end of April, 49 mc.

Mv intimate friend, Gaius Trebatius,¹’ has informed 1
me by letter that you questioned him as to my
whereabouts, and that you were vexed that owing to
your indisposition you had missed seeing me when I
approaehed the City walls ; and that at the present
moment you were anxious, if Ι could get nearer to
you, to confer with me as to the duty of each of us.
Would that it had been possible, Servius, for us to
have had a talk before all was lost ⁶——there is no
other word for it ! We should assuredly have been
of some service to the sinking state. For Ι had
already learned in my absence that you, foreseeing

sent by the Senate as an ambassador to Antony, who was
then besieging Mutina, and there he died. Long, in the
Dict. Bioyr„ says of him “ perhaps of all the men of his age,
οι· of any age, he was as an orator, a jurist, and an advocate
without an equal or a rival.'’ ⁶ See vii. 6-22.

⁶ ‘⁶ Before all was lost ” is Tyrrell's happy rendering of
salvis rebus.
