EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, II. xn1.-X1v.

to private persons of all ranks from highest to lowest,
what I propose to do is this—to set out for Cilicia on
May 15, and as soon as ever Ι have reached our
summer quartem, and made my military disposi-
tions, to quit the province in accordanee with the
decree of the Senate. I am anxious to see you as an
aedile, and it is wonderful how I long for Rome, and
all my friends, and for no one more than yourself.

Μ. Τ. CICERO, IMPERATOR, TO THE SAME
Laodicea, February, 50 mc.

I am on terms of the greatest intimacy with
Marcus Fadius,‘¹ a most excellent man and a very
distinguished scholar3 I have a wonderful liking
for him, not only for his pre-eminence in genius and
learning, but also for his singularly unassuming
demeanour. Ι should be glad if you would undertake
his business as though it were my own. Oh, I know
you, you famous advocates! If a man would avail
himself of your services, his proper course is to
commit a murder. But in this man's case I take, no
excuse. ’ You will drop everything else, if you will be
my friend, when Fadius desires the benefit of your
services. I am eagerly awaiting news of affairs at
Rome, indeed Ι am pining for it ; and most particu-
larly do I want to know how you are. The winter
has been so severe that it is now ever so long since
we had any news at all.
