succeed in diminishing my zeal on your behalf, there
is one thing in which you will not fail—-in making me
less concerned as to how you interpret my actions.
Ι write thus to you more frankly than usual, relying
on the consciousness of my services and goodwill;
and that goodwssl, based on deliberate conviction‚ I
shall maintain undiminished so long as it is your
pleasure that I should do so.

Although, as far as I could understand from your
letter, it seems that you will be at the gates of Rome ὓ
when you read this letter of mine, and the utterly
frivolous gossip of provincials has become flat and
stale, nevertheless, seeing that you wrote to me at
such length about the talk of unscrupulous men, I
felt bound to make a brief reply to your letter.

But the first two paragraphs of it 1 am obliged in
a way to pass over in silence 3 for there is nothing in
them that is either definite or positive, unless it be
that I had indicated by my looks and by my silence
that you were no friend of mine, and that this might
have been perceived both on the bench, when
some business was being transacted, and at certain
socia] gatherings. That all this amounts to nothing
at all, I can understand, but though it is nothing,

triumph. No magistrate could enter the city without forfeit-
ing his imperium, unless by a special decree. ” Tyrrell.
