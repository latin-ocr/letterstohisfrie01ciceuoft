EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. v111

Ι have ever kept in view the possibility of my enjoy-
ing the closest association with you. Indeed, I- well
remember that from that day you have never found
me fail in my respect for you, nor I you in your con· ‹
summate kindness and generosity to me. If there
have occurred any ruptures between us, due not so
much to acts as to suspicion on either side, false and
fanciful as they have proved to be, let them be eradi—
cated for ever from our hearts and lives. For such is
your character, and such I desire my own to be, that
faced as we are by the same politica] conditions, I
feel sure that our union and friendship will redound
to the credit of each of us.

And for that reason you, on your part, will decide 1·

for yourself what tribute of esteem should in your
judgement be paid me——and I trust you will make
that decision with proper regard to my deserts—
while Ι on my part explicitly promise you my active
support in a special and unprecedented degree, what-
ever the nature of the service required, provided the
object of it is your honour and renown. And in so
doing, though I shall find a large field of competitors,
Ι am sure I shall easily surpass them all in the judg-
ment of the world in general, and particularly of your
two sons. I am singularly attached to them both, but
while I am equally well-disposed to Marcus, I am the
more devoted to Publius, because, though indeed
he has always done so from his boyhood, still just now
he treats me with greater deference and affection
than ever, just as though Ι were a second father.

I should be glad if you would regard this document 5
as intended to have the force of a compatet, and not
of a mere letter, and believe that I shall most
solemnly observe, and most conscientiously perform,
