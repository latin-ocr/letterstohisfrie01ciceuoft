'ro THE SAMFJ'
Rome, middle of February, 56 mc.

You will be told what is going on here by ΡοῙΙίο,α 1
who has not only taken part, but taken a leading
part, in every transaction. As for myself, amid the
profound sorrow your affairs cause me, what comforts
me most, Ι would have you know, is a hope, nay, a
strong presentiment‚ that the unscrupulous conduct
of your foes will be crushingly countered‚ not only by
the shrewd suggestions of your friends, but also by the
action of time itself, which weakens the machinations
of those who hate, and would 'betray you.

In the second place, I find it easy to console myself 2
by recalling the dangers in my own life, a reflection of
which I recognize in your present circumstances ; for
though your high position is dishonoured in a less
important matter than that in which mine was
brought low, still the resemblance is so close, that I
trust you are not offended with me if I have shown
no sear of what even you yourself have never con-
sidered worth fearing. But prove yourself to be the
man Ι have ever known you to be “ from the days ” as
as the Greeks say “ when your finger-nails were
tenderss’ δ and, take my word for it, the injustice of
men will but serve as a foil to your greatness. Look
to me for every evidence of the highest devotion and
dutifulness to yourself, and I shall not disappoint you.
