EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, III. x.

M. Caelius ; and you also have written a good deal
about that same talk of his. Now for my own part
1 should have been more ready to break off a long-
standing connexion with a man who had undertaken
the representation of your enemies than to form any
fresh connexion with him. You ought to have no
doubt as to my devotion to you ; it is obvious to every-
body in the province, and it was obvious at Rome.

And yet there is a hint in your letter of a certain
suspicion and doubt in your mind, about which this is
not the right time to expostulate with you, but it is
the time to clearmyself, and I must. When did Ι
ever stand in the way of any deputation being sent
to Rome to eulogize you? Or how, if 1 were your
public enemy, could I have done less to injure you,
if your private enemy, how could I have shown my
hostility more openly? But supposing I were as
treacherous as they who heap such charges on my
head, even then Ι am sure Ι should not have been
such a fool as openly to parade my hostilities where
I wished to keep my hatred dark, or on the other
hand to betray an eager desire to do you harm by
an act which would do you no harm at all. I re-
member some people coming to me, it must have
been from Epictetus,⁰ to inform me that extravagant
sums were being voted to meet the expenses of
certain legates: my reply to them, which was not
so much a command as an expression of opinion, was
that sums for that purpose should be voted as nearly
as possible in accordance with the Cornelian law.⁶
And as evidence that I did not obstinately insist even
upon that, there are the accounts of the states, in
which the amount each state desires is entered as
paid over to your legates.
