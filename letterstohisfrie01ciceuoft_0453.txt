EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. xx,-xx1.

do 1 now regard the letter Ι received from you to-day
about the hundred sestertia as quite the same as the
dunning letters received by others in these hard times.
At the same time you ought to bear this in mind, 9
that all that money, which came to me in a perfectly
legal way, I deposited in the hands of the publi-
cani at Ephesus ; that it amounted to 2200
sestertia‚‘² and that the whole sum was carried off
by Pompey. Now whether I resign myself to that
loss, or whether I resent it, ou should certainly
resign yourself to the loss of t e hundred sestertia
and estimate that just so much less has come to you,
whether from your maintenanee allowance or from
my liberality ; but even if you had put me down as
your debtor for that hundred sestertia, still you are
such a charming fellow and so devoted to me, that
you would hesitate to proceed against me by way of
estate-valuation b at such a time as this 3 for anxious
as 1 might be to have the money paid you in cash,
I haven’t got it. But put that down as a jest on my
part, and I am sure you were jesting too. Anyhow,
when Tullius returns from the country, I shall send him
to you, if you think it has any bearing on the matter.
There is no reason why I should wish this letter to
be torn up.⁰

FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME
Rome, April, 46 1³.c.

Your letter gave me pleasure, as I understood from 1
it what I thought even without a letter, that you
feld) as being more in consonance with the tone of the whole

letter than non scindi. Cicero means that he has nothing
to sear from its publication.
