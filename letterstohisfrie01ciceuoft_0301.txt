EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IV. 1v.

But anyhow, seeing that I have now avoided giving
offence to one who, had Ι remained persistently
silent, might have thought that I do not regard this
as a constitutional governmcnt at all, I shall act in
that respect with moderation, or even keep on the
safe side of moderation, so as to serve his will without
sacrificing my own inclinations.

For though every department of liberal erudition,
and philosophy most of all, has been my delight from
my earliest manhood, yet this prepossession of mine
grows upon me day by day, partly, Ι suppose, because
my age is ripening for the reception of wisdom,
partly because the times are evil, so that there is
nothing else that can ease my mind of its annoyances.

You, as I gather from your letter, are drawn away
from such studies by press of business ; but still at
this season of the year, the nights will help you con-
siderably. Your, or rather our dear boy Servius,
shows me the greatest deference and respect, and I
am delighted as well with his general integrity and
excellent character as with his studies and acquire-
ments. He has many a talk with me about your
staying on or quitting the province. So far my
opinion holds, that we should do nothing but what we
think Caesar most desires. Such is the situation
here, that suppOsing you were at Rome, you could
find no pleasure in‘ anything except in your own
people. As for the rest, nothing could be better than
the great man himself 3 everybody and everything
else is such that—well, if you had to make the choice,
you would much rather hear about them than see
them. It is no pleasure to me to give you this
advice, as I am longing to see you 3 but I am think-
ing of what is best for you. Farewell.
