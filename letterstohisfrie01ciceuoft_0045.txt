EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, I. 11.

Hortensius’s motion came next, when the tribune 2
Lupus, on the ground that it was he who had raised
the question affecting Pompey, began to insist that
he should take precedence of the consuls in dividing
the house.⁰ His speech was answered by angry shouts
of dissent on every side, for it was as unfair as it was
unprecedented. The consuls neither yielded to him
nor showed any spirit in opposing him 3 what they
wanted was, that the day should be wasted‚ and that
is what happened ; for though they openly paraded
their agreement with Volcatius, they saw clearly
enough that a far greater number would vote for
Hortensius’s motion. Large numbers were asked their
35¹ffl2¹¹235¹sffi13¹33rtz’sseffitr‘gzssfflfisst235³&ssssss
motion should succeed. This dispute dragged on 3
till nightfall, and then the Senate was dismissed.

On that day Ι happened to dine at Pompey's
house, and availing myself of a more favourable
opportunity than I had ever had before (for since
you left Rome my prestige in the Senate had never
been higher than on that day) Ι spoke to him in such
a way that Ι think I drew his mind away from every
other line of thought to a due consideration of your
claims. And when I hear him speak himself, Ι aequit
him absolutely of any suspicion of selfish greed3 but
when I look round at his intimate friends of whatever
rank, I clearly perceive what must now be patent to
all, that your whole case has long since been basely
betrayed by certain people with the connivance of
the king himself and his counsellors.

I write this on the 15th of J anuary, before dawn ; 4
to-day there is to be a meeting of the Senate, and
Ι hope we shall maintain as honourable a position
