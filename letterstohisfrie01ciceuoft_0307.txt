EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IV. v.

on my right the Piraeus, on my left Corinth‚⁰ towns
at one time most flourishing,¹now lying prostrate and
demolished before one’s very eyes. I began ’co think
to myself ‘⁸ So! we puny mortals resent it, do we, if
one of us, whose lives are naturally shorter, has died
in his bed or been slain in battle, when ‘in this one
land alone there lie flung down before us the corpses
of so many towns ὓ ? ' Pray control yourself, Servius,
and remember that you were born a human being.’'
Take my word for it, I was not a little fortified by
that reflexion. This thought also, if you do not
mind, be careful to set before your eyes, Not so
long ago there perished at one and the same time

provinces have been shaken to their foundations ; are
you so profoundly moved by the loss of the spark of life
in one weak woman? If she had not met her death
to-day, she would in any event have had to die in a few
years' time, seeing that she was born a human being.

You, like myself‚ must call your' mind and thoughts
away from these subj ects, and bethink yourself rather
of what is worthy of the part you have to play,
remembering that she lived as long as h’fe was of use
to her ; that she and the Republic passed away
together 3Xthat she saw you, her father, elected
praetor, then consul, then augur ; that she had been
successively the bride of more than one youth of the

highest rank‚⁶ that she enjoyed almost every blessing
in life ; and it was with the fall of the Republic that

she ceased to live. What reason have either you or
she for quarrelling with fortune on this score?

⁶ She had married successively Piso, Crassipes, and
Dolabella.
