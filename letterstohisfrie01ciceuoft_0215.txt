EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, III. v.

myself Ι will explain to you. On J uly 31, Ι think I
shall be at Laodicea, where I shall stay for a very
few days, while Ι receive some money due to me on
the Treasury Bill of Exchange.‘¹ After that I shall
make my way to the army, so that about August 13 Ι
expect to be in the neighbourhood of Iconium. But
if 1 make any mistake at the moment of writing (for
1 am far from what is now going on and the places I
mention), as soon as I begin to advance, by as speedy
and frequent communications as possible I shall
ensure your being apprised of the whole programme
of my dates and routes. As for laying any burden
on your shoulders, I have not the courage, nor is it
my duty, to do so· But so far as is possible without
inconvenience to yourself, it is of great importance
to each of us that I should see you before you leave.
Even if any accident snatches the opportunity out
of our grasp, still my every duty to you will be per-
formed as punctiliously as if Ι had seen you. It is
not my intention to send you any message by letter
concerning my affairs until I have abandoned all hope
of being able to confer with you in person.

You say that you requested Scaevola ⁶ to take com-
mand of the province in your absence until my arrival ;
well, Ι saw him myself at Ephesus, and he was my
intimate companion during the three days I stayed
at Ephesus, and I got nothing out of him indicating
that you had given him any commission at all. And
I could have heartily wished that he had been able

to comply with vour desire· for Ι do not suppose he
would have had any objection.
