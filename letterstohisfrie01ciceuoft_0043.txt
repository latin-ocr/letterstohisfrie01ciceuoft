EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, Ι. 1.-—11.

ledged by everybody, and my affection for you, far
away as you are, by your friends on the spot. Were
there any sense of honour in those in whom, above
all others, it should be found, there would be no
difficulties in our way. Farewell.

Rome, January 15, 56 mc.

Nothing was settled in the Senate on J anuary 13,
because a great part of the day was taken up with a
dispute between the consul Lentulus ⁰ and the tri-
bune Caninius. I, too, spoke a good deal on that
day, and appeared to make a great impression on the
Senate by insisting on your goodwill towards it. So ”
on the following day we resolved to be brief in ex-
pressing our opinions, for it seemed that the Senate
had again become favourably inclined to us ; of this
I had assured myself not only in the course of my
speech, but when I appealed to individual members,
and asked for their support. And so when Bibulus’s
motion “ that three commissioners should restore the
king” was first read out for discussion, and then,
Hortensius’s, “ that you should restore him, but with-
out an army,’' and thirdly Volcatius’s, “ that Pompey
should restore him,” a demand was made that
Bibulus‘s motion should be submitted in two parts.b
As long as he confined himself to the religious
argument, which could no longer be opposed, he met
with agreement3 but on the question of the three
commissioners, a large majority voted against him!
