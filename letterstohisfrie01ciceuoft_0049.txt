EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, Ι. 111.—1v.

1 earnestly beg of you not to let him be dis· 2
appointed in this anticipation, and I commend to your
care all his business affairs, his freedmen, his agents,
and his slaves; and especially do I ask you to con-
firm T. Ampius’s α decrees in connexion with his case,
and in all respects so to deal with him that he may
realize that my recommendation of him was no con-
ventional formality. Farewell.

Rome, J anuary, 56 mc.

On the fifteenth of J anuary we brilliantly main· 1
tained our position in the Senate3 we had already
on the preceding day given the coup de grdce to
that motion of Bibulus concerning the three com-
missioners, and the only subject of controversy left
over was Volcatius’s motion, though the opposition
spun the affair out by various pettifogging objections.
We upheld our cause in a full house, in spite of the
same endless variety of arguments and the un-
disguised jealousy of those ¹² who were for taking the
affair of the king out of your hands and putting it
elsewhere. On that day we found Curio disagree-
able, Bibulus much more reasonable, in fact almost
friendly: Caninius and Cato assured the house that
they would pass no law before the elections. As you
are aware, the Lex Pupia ⁶ precludes the holding
there could be no meeting of the Senate for ordinary purposes
either in J anuary (after the 15th) or in February, unless the

business of the deputations was either disposed of or deferred
to some later date.
