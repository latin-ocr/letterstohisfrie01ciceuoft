EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, I. 1x.

favour you have sent recommendations from the
⁴ends of the earth. But don' t alarm yourself3 for
those same persons are, and always will be, praised
by me also. However, in the matter of Vatinius’ s
defence, Ι had another motive to spur me οιι; as I
remarked at the trial when Ι was pleading for him,
I was doing just what the Parasite urged the Captain
to do in the Eunuchus α :

When Phaedria's name she utters, you'll reply

His looks if she praise, praise you hers no less:
Such tit· for· tat will cause her deep distress.

certain noble friends of mine, who had shown me
the greatest kindness in the past, were now evincing
an undue affection for my special enemy, and before
my very eyes were constantly either drawing him
aside, as if for solemn consultation, or else playing
“ hail fellow well met ” with him, since they had
their Publius, I begged the jury, I say, to allow me,
too, another Publius of my own, in dealing with
whom Ῑ might give my friends' conscience a sly dig
or two just to show that Ι was a little annoyed with
them ; and I not only said so, but I do so again and
again, to the delight of gods and men.

So much for Vatinius ; now let me tell you about 20
Crassus. ὸ Since he and I were by this time on quite
good terms (for ιιι the interests of public harmony Ι
had, as it were, expunged by a voluntary amnesty
the whole list of his grossly injurious acts), Ι should
have put up with his sudden defence of Gabinius ⁰—
