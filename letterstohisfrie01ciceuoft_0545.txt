you will thus avoid of a long voyage in winter, where
there are very few harbours to run into, this also is
a consideration of no trivial importance, that you
can get away from where you are, as soon as you
hear anything definite, at a moment’s notice. There
is, moreover, no reason whatever for your being in
such a hurry to meet thernd on their approach.

with the greatest ease and expedition. But if Caesar
returns at the proper time, you will be on the spot ;
