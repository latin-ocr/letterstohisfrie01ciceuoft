EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. xxn.

XXII

CICERO To CN. DOMITIUS AHENOBARBUS ⁰
Rome, month uncertain, 46 mc.

It was not the fact of your having sent me nol
letter that put me off writing to you after your
arrival in Italy; no, it was because Ι could not
think of any promise I could make you, being
myself utterly destitute, or of any course of action
I could recommend, having no policy whatever of
my own, or of any consolation I could offer you in
these terrible times. Although the present situation
shows no improvement whatever and is even far
more hopeless than it was, still I thought that a
letter from me with nothing in it would be better

than no letter at all.
If I believed that you had attempted in the 2

interests of the state to undertake a task ὃ beyond
your power to accomplish, I should still urge you,
to the best of my ability, to accept such terms of
life as were offered you, and were available. But
seeing that you have resolved that the policy you
so honourably and gallantly adopted should cease
from the very moment when it had pleased fortune
herself to put an end to our struggles,⁰ I beg and
implore of you in the name of our old and intimate
connexion and of my most sincere affection for
you, and of yours, just as sincere, for myself, to
keep yourself out of harm for all our sakes‚ for
the sake of your motherfl your wife, and all your
family, to whom you are and always have been

⁶ By the defeat of Pompey at Pharsalia.
