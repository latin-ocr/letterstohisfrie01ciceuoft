EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. 1.-11.

mourning‚⁰ I, who govern a province, I, who com-
mand an army, Ι, who am conducting a war Ξ And
seeing that your procedure in these matters has
been marked neither by reasonableness nor the
clemency of our ancestors, ¹³ nobody need be surprised
if you all live to regret it. Ι did not expect to find
you so fickle- hearted in your dealings with me and
mine. Meanwhile, speaking for myself‚ no family
sorrow, no act of injustice on the part of any man,
shall seduce me from my duty to the state.

already decided it was incumbent upon you to pay
me in the Senate. In saying this, however, I was
careful to add, that the duty of maintaining the
safety of the state had been so apportioned between
us, that while I defended the City from treachery
at home and intestine outrage, you guarded Italy
