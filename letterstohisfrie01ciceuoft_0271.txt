EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, III. xl.

of Flaccus,‘⁸ Ι shall take action myself on my home-
ward journey through Asia.·

Now I come to your second letter. You send me 4
a well outlined sketch-plan, as I may call it, of the
crisis as it affects both of us, and of the general
political situation, and Ι am very grateful for the
insight you show in your letter3 for I gather that
the dangers are less than Ι feared, and the safeguards
greater, if, as you write, all the strength of the state
has put itself at the disposal of Pompey 3 and at the
same time I recognized your promptitude and alert-
ness in the defence of the Republic, and I derived
extraordinary pleasure from the pains you took, Ι
mean in being so kind as to send me word of the
political situation, engrossed as you were in matters
of such vast importance. For pray put away the
“augural books ’² until we are both at leisure3 I
assure you that when Ι kept urging and pressing you
by letter to fulfil your promises, I was under the
impression that you had absolutely nothing to do
while waiting outside the City. As it is, however,
according to your own promise, instead of the
‘⁶ augura] books ’' I shall look forward to having all
your “ orations '’ complete.

Decimus Tullius, whom you entrusted with a 5
message for me, has not yet met me ; and there is
now not one of your people with me, except all my
people, who are all equally yours. What letter of
mine it is you describe as unduly choleric I cannot
make out. I wrote to you twice, clearing myself
carefully, and mildly rebuking you for having too
readily believed what was said of me ; and it seemed
to me, that kind of remonstrance was befitting in a
friend ; but if you do not like it, I shall not adopt it
