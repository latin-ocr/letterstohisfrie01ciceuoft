EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. XIv.-XV.

exclusively your own. Ι am anxious· not to pester
you, if this friendly earnestness on my part is dis-
tasteful to you ; but I am anxious to discourage your
persistence in the course you have adopted. Now Ι
am distracted by those two incompatible desires3
and I should wish you either to take my advice, if
possible, as regards the latter of them, or not to be
offended with me as regards the former.a Farewell.

CICERO TO LUCCEIUS
Astura, May 10-12, 45 13.c.

The full measure of your affection for me stands l
completely revealed in the letter Ι last received from
you ; not that I was unaware of it, but it is none the
less agreeable and welcome to me—I should have
said ‘¹ delightful ’' had not that word dropped out of
my vocabulary for all time, and not for that reason
only which you surmise‚ and as to which, while
employing the most gentle and loving terms, in
substance you reprimand me severely, but because
everything that should have helped to heal the
bitter wound has ceased to exist.

For what am Ι to do ? Am I to take refuge with 2
my friends ? How many, tell me, are left of them ?
For they were for the most part yours as much as
mine; but some of them have fallen, and others
have somehow grown callous. I certainly might
have lived with you, and nothing would have given
me greater pleasure; old acquaintance, affection,

⁸ i.e.‚ ‘⁶ my pestering·you by my importunity.”
