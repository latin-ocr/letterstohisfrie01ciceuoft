EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, III. v11.

Stoics are right in regarding as a virtue—do you, Ι
ask, suppose that any Appiism or Lentulism in the
world weighs more with me than the distinctions

enabling you to realize the truth of what I say. If
it is your object, however, to make it appear that you
are less bound to further my interests in my absence
than I strove to further yours, I release you from

that anxiety :
