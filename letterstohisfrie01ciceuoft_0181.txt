EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, ΙΙ. Χνῐ

Τ. Ampius ⁰ told me, and you saw how Ι hated the idea
of leaving Rome. When Ι heard it, did I not declare
to you that I would suffer any hardship on earth
sooner than leave Italy to take part in a civil war ?
What has happened then to make me change my
mind? Nay rather what has not happened to con-
firm me in my opinion? I should be glad if you
would take my word for this———and I fancy it is what
you think yourself—that I look for nothing else as
the outcome of these miseries but that the world
may at last realize that my one dominant desire was
for peace ; that, when there was no hope of peace,
there was nothing I so persistently avoided as civil
arms. My consistent conduct in this respect Ι
think I shall never have reason to regret. Indeed
I remember, that, in discussing such matters, it was a
frequent boast of my dear friend, Q. Hortensius, that
he had never taken part in civil warfare. My credit
will be the more conspicuous in so far as in his
case it was attributed to lack of spirit, whereas in my
case I do not think such an idea could be possibly

entertained.
And you do not frighten me with the arguments 4

you so very loyally and lovingly set before me to

intimidate me. Why, in this world-convulsion there

is no bitterness of woe that does not seem to hang

over the heads of all of us-and most gladly would Ι

have diverted this woe from the state at the cost of

{llily 0W111¹ prilivalte and domestic tssoubles, aye, even of

To my son y(I am glad you like him) if any 5
form of government survives, I shall leave a
sufficiently handsome inheritance in memory of
my name; if there is no government at all, he
