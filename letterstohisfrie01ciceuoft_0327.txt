EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IV. IX.

of you to be moved by the sense of sight alone, and
to be less distressed when the same fact reaches you
by hearsay, when it often appears even worse than
it is. .

But (you will argue) you, like the rest of us, will 2
have to say something you do not feel, and do some-
thing you do not approve. In the first place, it has
ever been considered the mark of a wise man to yield
to circumstances, in other words, to bow to the
inevitable ; in the second place, as matters now
stand, things are not as bad as all that. Perhaps
you are not at liberty to say what you think, but you
are quite at liberty to say nothing. For all power
has been put in the hands of one man, who follows no
man’s advice but his own, not even that of his own
friends.

And it would have been much the same, if he‘¹
whom we followed were in charge of the Republic.
Can we possibly suppose that the man who in time of
war, when we were all united by a common danger,
took counsel of himself alone and a notorious clique
of exceedingly indiscreet advisers, would have been
likely to be less sels-centredb in the hour of his
triumph than he had been when the issue was in
the balance? And can you suppose that he who
neither followed your excellently wise advice when
you were consul, nor when your cousin discharged
the functions of consul with your support, was
inclined to avail himself of the counsel of either of you,
would now, if he held everything in his hands, have
been likely to desire the expression of our opinions?

All is misery in civil wars3 our ancestors never 3
even once had that experience 3 our generation has
already had it several times3 but nothing is more
