EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, ΙΙΙ. vn

because, as you say, I hindered their building opera-
tions by the letter Ι wrote. In the same despatch
also you request me to release them from my objec-
tion and enable them to go on building as soon as
possible, so that they may not find winter suddenly
upon them ; and at the same time you complain with
much bitterness that I forbade them to exact a tax ‘¹
before I had investigated the matter and given them
leave to do so, which you said practically meant
putting a stop to their building, since I could only
make the investigation after I returned from Cilicia
for the winter.

On all these counts, listen to my reply and recog-
nize the fairness of your remonstrance. In the first
place, when I had been approached by men who
declared that they were the victims of intolerable
exactions, what unfairness was there in my writing
that they⁶ should hold their hands until I had in-
vestigated the affair and what led up to it ? Do you
really suppose that I could do nothing before winter ?
for that is what you write. Really ! as though I had
to come to them, and not they to me, to hold an in-
vestigation. ‘⁸ All that distance? ” you say. What?
when you gave them the letter in which you pleaded
with me not to hinder their building before winter,
were you then under the impression that they would
not come to me ? Anyhow what they did was ludi-
crous3 the letter they brought me, asking that it
might be possible for them to do the work in the
summer, that letter they did not put into my hands
till after midwinter. But let me tell you firstly, those
who object to pay the tax are far more numerous
than those who press for its exaction, and secondly‚
thatin spite of that I am going to do what, I take it,
