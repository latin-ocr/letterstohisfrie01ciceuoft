EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. xx.

separate point if M. Tullius,‘¹ my secretary, were here,
though as regards him, Ι have satisfied myself that in
the matter of making up the accounts at all events
(as to the other matters Ι cannot speak so positively)
he never wittingly did anything incompatible with
either your interests or your good name ; and, in the
next place, supposing the old law and ancient custom
as to handing in the accounts were still in force, I
assure you that I should never have thought of
handing them in without having first, in view of our
intimate official connexion, checked them and made
them up with you.

And so what I should have done near Rome, had 2
the traditional procedure been still observed, that
I did in the province, since it was necessary accord-
ing to the Julian law to leave the accounts behind in
the province, and to send in an exact duplicate of
them to the Treasury3 and I did so not so as to
induce you to accept my own calculations as con-
clusive, but I gave you as free a hand as Ι shall
never regret having given you. I put my secretary
entirely at your service (though 1 see that you now
suspect him), and it was you who put your cousin,
M. Mindius} in touch with him. The accounts were
made up in my absence when you were present, and
I never interfered with them at all except that I
perused them 3 and my having received an account-
book from my slave and secretary was the same thing
as my having received it from your cousin. If this was
a comph‘ment, I could have paid you no greater ; if a
mark of confidence, I showed you almost more than
I showed myself ; had it been my duty to take pre-
cautions to prevent any return being made that
would prejudice either your honour or your interests,
