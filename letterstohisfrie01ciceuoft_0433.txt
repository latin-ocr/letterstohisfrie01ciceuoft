EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. xvn.

matters then stood, the unpopularity roused by the
price of corn, the hostility not only of your own, but
also of your friends’ enemies, the unfairness of the
whole trial, and many other defects in the constitu-
tion, had proved stronger than the merits of the case
and truth itself, Ι never failed⁴ to put my services,
advice, efforts, influence, and testimony at the dis-
posal of your son Publius.

And for that reason having scrupulously and 3
religiously satisfied all the claims of friendship, I
did not think it right to omit the further duty of
exhorting and entreating you to remember, that,
though a mortal, you are yet a man3 in other words,
to bear philosophically our common lot of fickle
change and chance, which no single one of us can
either avoid or vouch for, to defy sorrow and mis-
fortune with a stout heart ; and to reflect that in our
state, as in all others that have risen to empire, the
like calamities have befallen the bravest and best of
men through the injustice of tribunals. Would it
were not the truth when I write that the state from
which you are cut off is one in which no man of
discernment could find any reason for gratification.

Now as to your son, Ι am afraid that, if I say 4
nothing about him in my letter, it will appear as
though I had omitted to testify to his merits as much
as he deserves ; but if, on the other hand, I write down
all I feel, I fear that I shall so cause a recrudesccnce
of your regret and sorrow. But anyhow the most
sensible thing you can do is to look upon his filial
affection, his sterling character, and his assiduity as
your own assets, ready to your hand wherever you
happen to be ; for what we make our own in imagina-
tion is not less ours than what we see with our eyes.
