EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, I,V. 1v.

modest '') 3 and yet even so (and there is no “ mock-
modesty ” in this either) I readily acknowledge your
superiority in the refinement and good taste⁰ of
your compositions.

T hat policy of yours which, as you write, led you 2
not to decline this post in Achaia, I have always
approved, and approve much more heartily now that
I have read your last letter ; for all the reasons you
specify are perfectly sound and quite worthy of your
high position and sagacity. You think that in this
case things have not turned out as you expected;
well, there I do not agree with you at all. The fact
is that so appalling is the general disorganization and
chaos, so irremediable the overthrow and prostration
of every interest by this most horrible war, that
every man thinks that where he happens to be is the
most miserable place, and himself the most miserable
person in the world ; and that is precisely why you
not only regret your policy, but also imagine that we
who are at home are happy ; while we on the other
hand consider you to be, not indeed free from all
annoyances, but still happy as compared with our-
selves. Moreover, in this particular respect your
lot is better than ours—you venture to put in writing
what is troubling you, we cannot do even that with
any safety ; and that is through no fault of the
victor, who is a marvel of moderation‚ but of the
victory itself, which in civil wars is ever overbearing.

On one point I claim a victory over you 3 I got to 3
know of the restoration of your colleague- Marcellus?

this letter. Cicero formally expressed his gratitude to
Caesar in his speech Pro Marcello. Returning to Rome,
Marcellus got as far as the Piraeus, where he was murdered
by P. Magius Cilo (see Ep. xii. of this Book).
