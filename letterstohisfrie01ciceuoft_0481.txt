EPISTULAE AD FAMILI‘AREs, VI. ιν.

You remember the bitterness of my grief, in 4
which my chief consolation is, that Ι saw further
than anybody else, when what I desired, however
unfavourable the terms, was peace. And though
that is due to mere chance, and no prophetie inspira-
tion of mine, Ι still find a pleasure in the hollow credit
of having been far-seeing.

In the second place, and this is a source of con-
solation common to both of us, if I were now called
upon to quit the stage of life, the Republic from
which I should have to tear myself is not one which
it would pain me to forgo, especially when the
change would deprive me of all perception. My age
too makes it easier for me, and the fact that my
life is now at its close, and not only is it gladdened
by the thought of a course well run, but it forbids my
fearing any violence in that change to which nature
herself has nearly brought me.

And lastly, the man, Ι might even say the men,
who have fallen in this war were of such a character,
that it seems an act of shamelessness not to accept
the same doom should circumstances compel it. For
my own part, there is no contingency I do not con-
template, and there is no calamity so crushing but
that I believe it to be hanging over my head. But
since there is more evil in our anticipation of it than
in the very thing we dread, I am ceasing to sear,
especially as what hangs over me not only involves
no pain, but will itself be the end of pain.

But what I have said is enough, or rather more
than I need have said ς it is not my garrulity,
however, but my friendliness that is to blame for
the unusual length of my letters.

I was sorry that Servius ‘² should have left Athens 3 5
