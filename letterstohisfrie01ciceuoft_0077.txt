EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, 1. vm.

much am Ι influenced by the promptings of my
heart, and, I emphatically add, my friendly feeling
towards Pompey, that what is expedient to him
and what he desireS‚ now appear to me in every
case right and proper3 and, to my thinking, even
his opponents would make no mistake, if, seeing
they could be no match for him, they were to call a
truce.

I have myself this further consolation, that I am 3
the kind of man whose decision would be accepted by
everybody with the warmest approval, whether it were
to support what Pompey advocates, or to keep silent,
or even (as is my particular inclination) to return to
my former literary pursuits‚ and this last I shall un-
doubtedly do,if my friendship for Pompey permits me.
For what had once been my aim and object after
I had discharged the most honourable public offices
and completed my very arduous labours-—the
dignified deliverance of my opinions in the Senate,
and an independent position in dealing with public
affairs-that I have lost for ever, and Ι not more than
anybody else 3 for we must either utterly humiliate
ourselves by agreeing with a minority, or disagree
with them to no purpose.

I write thus to you chiefly for this reason, that it 4
may lead you to reflect at last on your own scheme of
life. The senate, the law-courts, and the whole state
have undergone a complete change. Tranquillity is
what I must pray for, and that those who are at the
head of affairs seem likely to guarantee me, if certain
persons α prove themselves less intolerant of their
supremacy3 as for that consular dignity of the in-
trepid and consistent senator, I have no grounds for
wasting a thought on it ; it has been los‘t for ever by
