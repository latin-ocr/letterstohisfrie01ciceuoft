EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. xlx.

you plainly told me in a certain letter—that you
would be more assiduous in showing your respect for
me than you had been in the province (although in
my opinion your courtesy when in office there left
nothing to be desired) in proportion as you could be
more free to use your own judgment. And so not
only was Ι extremely pleased with your former
letter, which showed me that you had looked forward
to my arrival with the eagerness of a friend, and
that, though things had not turned out as you had
anticipated, you were greatly delighted with the
policy I had adopted, but I have also derived no
little pleasure from the expression, in this last letter of
yours, of your judgment, as well as of your kindness ;
your judgment, because I understand that, as all
good and gallant men ought to do, you deem nothing
to be expedient but what is right and honourable;
your kindness, because you promise that, whatever
policy I shall have adopted, you will be at my side,
and nothing can be at once more agreeable to me and
in my opinion more honourable to yourself than that.
My plans have been laid long ago, but I have 2
written nothing to you about them before, not that
it was necessary to keep you in ignorance of
them, but because to share your plans with another
at such a crisis seems to be almost tantamount to
reminding him of his duty, or rather entreating him
urgently to become your partner in something either
dangerous or difficult. However, your goodwill,
kindheartedness, and friendly feeling for me being
what it is, I warmly welcome such an attitude of
mind on your part, but only on these terms (you see
I am not going to abandon my usual modesty in
making requests)-—if you do what you declare you
