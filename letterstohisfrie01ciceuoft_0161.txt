EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, II. x.—xr.

that prove, as you write and Ι can well believe, too
heavy clay for your plough,⁰ then (and that is easy
enough) that there should be no prolongation of my
tenure of office. On the subject of politics‚ I look to
your letters, as I wrote to you before, for an account
of current, and, even more, for a forecast of coming
events. I therefore earnestly beg of you to write
to me fully on all points with all possible assiduity.

Μ. Τ. CICERO, IMPERATOR, To THE SAMD,
Now CURULE AEDILE

Laodicea, April 4, 50 13.c.

Would you ever have thought it possible that
words would fail me, and not only those oratorical
words you public speakers use, but the ordinary,
homely words I use ? And yet they do fail me, and
for this reason—I am extraordinarily anxious as to
what on earth may be deereed about the provinces.
It is surprising how I yearn for Rome3 you cannot
believe how I yearn for my friends, and particularly
for you; but as to the province, I am heartily sick
of it, whether it be because I seem-to have attained
such a measure of fame, that* I should not so much
seek any addition to it, as apprehend a reverse of
fortune, or because the whole business is unworthy
of my powers, seeing that I can, and often do, carry
heavier burdens in the service of the state3 or
because we have hanging over us the horror of a
great war, which I seem likely to escape if I quit the
province on the appointed day.
