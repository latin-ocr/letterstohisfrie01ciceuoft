EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, III. vm.

although both of us have acted conscientiously‚ but
have not both followed the same line, that man Ι am
not anxious to have for my friend.

Your liberality, characteristic of so great a noble-
man, covered a wider field in the province ; if mine
was more circumscribed (though your own open-
handed and bountiful nature had to be somewhat
modified in your second year of office,‘¹ owing to a
certain unhappiness in the times), still, seeing that it
has ever been my nature to fight shy of extravaganee
at the expense of others, and that the times have the
same effect upon myself as upon others, men ought
not to be surprised that

I give them gall to give my conscience honey.⁶

You have given me information about affairs in the
City; that was not only gratifying to me in itself,
but also because it showed that all my messages to
you would have your attention. Among them is one
to which Ι beg of you to give particular attention-—
to see to it that no addition is made to my duties
here, in the way of either responsibility or length of
tenure of office3 and also to ask Hortensius, my
fellow-augur and intimate friend, if he has ever
either voted or done anything in my favour, to
abandon also this proposal of his that I should hold
office for two years; for nothing could be more
unkind to me.

You wish to know about my affairs3 well, I left
Tarsus on October 7, and made for Amanus ; I write
this on the day following that on which I was encamped
in the region of Mopsuhestia. If I succeed in doing
anlrtffng'hl shalltwrite to you13 and ΙΙ εὴέΠ ἓὲἶνει· send
