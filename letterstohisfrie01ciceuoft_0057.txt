but as to what is still in the region of conjecture and
only seems likely to happen, I think I ought to write
to ou myself. When Pompey spoke in defence of
Milo ‘¹ before the people on February the 6th, he was

claims except what, for the same religious reasons,
can be granted to nobody else.

What I now hope for, what I am striving to bring
about, is that the king, when he understands that
he cannot manage to be restored, as he had intended,
by Pompey, and that, unless he is reinstated through
your agency, he will be a pariah and an outcast,
should come and visit you 3 and that is what he un-
