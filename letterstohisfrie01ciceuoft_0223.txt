EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, ΙΙΙ. V1.-v11.

unless you write and tell me, it is impossible for me
to have even the slightest idea when or where I shall
see ou.

disposed towards you. Of your feelings towards me
you appear to have given our foes no slight grounds
for thinking otherwise ; it will be a great pleasure to
me if you succeed in correcting that impression. And
——to enable you to calculate at what spot you may
meet me, and still observe the Cornelian law ⁰—1
arrived in the province on July 31 ; Ι am making
my way into Cilicia through Cappadocia3 I move
my camp from Iconium on Au ust 29. And now
with these dates and this plan o my route to guide
you, if you still think it incumbent upon you to meet
me, it is for you to decide at what place you can most
conveniently do so, and on what day.

Brgtttllseputation from Appia ὓ have delivered to me 2

a roll from you full of the most unfair complaints,
