EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. 111.—1v.

And, understanding this ‘¹ so fully, Ι see such a 3
position that it seems that it will be no evil if, even
before a decisive victory, that befalls which is held
out as being of all things the most to be dreaded.⁶
For to live on such terms as we should have to live
after that is the depth of misery, but no wise man
has ever held that to die is any misery, even for
one who is in prosperity. But you are in a city in
which the very walls of the houses themselves seem
able to say all this, or even more, and after a nobler
fashion.

I can assure you of this, thOugh it is but a poor 4
consolation that is based on the miseries of others,
that you are in no whit greater danger now than
any one either of those who have gone off to the war,
or of those who have stayed at home. The former
are engaged in battle, the latter fear the conqueror.

That‚ however, is a poor consolation3 this other
one has greater weight, and I hope you take advan-
tage of it, as I certainly do; for never, while I exist,
shall anything cause me pain, as long as I am guilt-
less of any wrong conduct; and if I cease to exist,
I lose all sensation.

But here again in writing thus to you I am but
‘⁶ sending an owl to Athens.” ⁰ You and yours and
all you possess are my chief concern, and will be as
long as I live.
