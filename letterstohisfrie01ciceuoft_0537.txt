CICERO 'ro BITHYNICUS
Place and date uncertain

I greet you. While Ι have every other reasonl
for desiring the establishment some day or other of
a Republic, I would have you believe that I have
an additional reason which increases my longing for
it, and that is the promise you make in your letter 3
for you write that in that event you will spend
your days in my company. ⁴

It is a great pleasure to me that you should wish 2
to do so, and your wish is in exact accord with our
intimate friendship, and the opinions of me expressed
from time to time by that prince of men, your father.
For let me assure you that while those who have been,
or still are, according to the vicissitudes of the
times, in a position to help you are more closely
bound to you by the magnitude of their services,
there is no man more closely so bound by the ties
of friendship than myself. And that is why Ι am
so delighted at your not only remembering our
intimacy, but even wishing to increase it.
