EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. xa.

ought to possess, you also would be what you
formerly were—at once most worthy of every highest
position and assuredly in your own order a easily
the foremost man.

But now that we have both been ruined under the

same political conditions and fo'r the same reason, I ’

promise you not only what Ι have specified above,j
which is still mine to promise, but also whatever
besides I seem to myself still to retain out of the
remnants, as it were, of my old—time dignity., For
Caesar himself, as I have been able to gather from
many indications, is not unfavourably inclined· to
me, and practically all his most intimate friends
also, being, as it so h'appens, under an obligation to
me' forsignal services in the -past, are showing me
marked attention and respect.

And so, if I find any way open to me to deal with
the matter of your fortunes, that is to say, your
reinstatement in your rights—for everything depends
upon that and what they tell me makes me daily
more disposed to be hopeful about it—then I shall
deal with it personally and energetically.

1 need not go into details. All my devotion and 3
friendliness I lay at your feet without reserve. But
it is of great importance to me that all your people
should know this, and all that is required is a letter
from you, so that they may understand that whatever
belongs to Cicero is at the disposal of Trebianus.
My object in doing this is to convince them that·
nothing is so difficult but that my undertaking it on
your behalf would be a pleasure.
