EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, I. 1v

of a Senate before February l, and indeed during the
whole of February, unless the business of the deputa-
tions has been either djsposed of or adjourned.

The popular opinion here, however, is this, that the 2
plea of religious scruples, falsely so called, was intro-
duced by your envious calumniators, not so much to
hamper you in particular, as to prevent anyone’s
wishing to go to Alexandria from a selfish desire for
military command. But as to your own claims,
everyone considers that all proper regard has been
paid them by the Senate 3 for everyone is aware that
the fact that no division took place is due to the
‘machinations of your opponents3 if, however, they
now attempt to carry any measure on the alleged
grounds of serving the people, but in reality because
of the infamous villainy of the tribunes, I have taken
every precaution to prevent their being able to do so
without a violation of either the auspices or the law,
or indeed without a breach of the peace. .

There is no need, I think, for any reference in this 3
letter either to my own devotion to you or to the in-
jurious conduct of certain persons ; for why should
I vaunt my own services‚—-I‚ the shedding of whose
life-blood in defence of your claims would not, it
seems to me, counterbalance a fraction of your
deserts ? Or why, on the other hand, deplore the in-
jurious acts of others at the eost of bitter anguish
to myself ? I can guarantee your cause no pro-
tection against violence, especially now that the
magistrates are so powerless3 but apart from that
Ι ean assure you that the enthusiastic support of
the Senate and the people of Rome will enable you
to maintain your distinguished position unimpaired.
Farewell.
