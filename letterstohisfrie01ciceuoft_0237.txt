EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, III. vm.

being dispatched to express their gratitude to you,
but not as a private person, and not in their own
priVate interests, but in those of the state, and not
in a private place, but in the council chamber of the
world—the· Senate : and when I made an edict that
nobody should set out for Rome without my per-
missi0n‚ I did not extend my prohibition to those
who were unable (as they said) to follow me all the
way to camp or across the Taurus.‘² That is the most
ridiculous passage in your letter3 for what reason
had they for following me to camp or crossing the
Taurus, when Ι arranged my journey from Laodicea
right up to Iconium for the very purpose of enabling
the magistrates and legates of all those assize
districts ὓ which lie this side of Taurus, and of all the
states there, to meet me? Unless you mean to say 5
that deputations did not begin to be sent until I had
crossed the Taurus, and that is certainly not the ease.
For when I was at Laodicea, at Apamea, at Synnada,
at Philomelium, and at Iconium (and I spent some
time in each of those towns), all the deputations of
that sort had already been constituted. And any-
how there is this also that I would have you know,
that Ι made no decree respecting either the reduc-
tion or the repayment of the expenses of the deputa-
tions beyond what the leading men of the states
demanded of me—that quite unnecessary expenses
should not be piled upon the sale of the taxes ⁰
and that bitterly resented exaction (you know all
about it) of the poll-tax and the door-tax. When,
however, moved by a sense of justice and of com-
passion also, Ι had taken upon myself to relieve the

their own taxes, fell into arrears; and the publicani were
ever assiduous in their own interests.
