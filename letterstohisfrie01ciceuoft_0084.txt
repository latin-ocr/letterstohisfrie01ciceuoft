CICERO

reprehendere ascribis. Vatinium autem sciren-te
velle ostendis, quibus rebus adductus defenderim et
laudarim. Quod tibi ut planius exponam, altiusvpaulo
rationem consiliorum meorum repetam necesse estest

Ego me, Lentule, initio, beneficio1 rerum atque
actionum tuarum, non solum meis, sed etiam-:rei-
publicae restitutum putabam, et, quoniam tibi
incredibilem quemdam amorem et omnia in te ipsum
summa ac singularia studia deberem, reipublicae,
quae te in me restituendo multum adiuvisset, eum
certe me animum merito ipsius debere arbitrabar,
quem antea tantummodo communi officio civium,

⁰ P. Vatinius, a political adventurer, and no less of* a
scoundrel (as he himself maintained) than P. Clodius, was
quaestor in 63 and tribune in 59, when he sold his services
to Caesar, then consul with Bibulus, and proposed the Lex
Vatinia, giving Caesar Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum for
five years. In 56 he witnessed against Cicero's friends,
Milo and Sestius, and was vehemently attacked by the
orator. In 55 he was praetor, and in 54 was accused of
bribery by Licinius Calvus, and defended, aa explained
here, by Cicero. He was consul suffectus for a few days at
the end of 47. In 46 he was fairly successful as governor of
Illyricum (cf. v. lOa and 10 b). After Caesar's death he was
compelled to sui-render Dyrrhachium and his army to Brutus.
