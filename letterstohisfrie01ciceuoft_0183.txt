EPISTULAE‘AD FAMILIARES, 11. xv1.

will be no exception to the common lot of his fellow-
citizens.

When you ask me to keep an eye on the interests
of my own son-in-law, excellent youth as he is, and
very dear to me, can you, when you know how much
both he, and, of course, my dear Tullia are to me, can
you, Ι say, doubt that my solicitude for them causes
me intense anxiety? And all the more so since,
amid the universal misery, Ι had still this gleam of
hope to comfort me, that my, or rather our Dolabella
would be freed from those embarrassments in which
his liberality had involved him. I should like you to
inquire what sort of settling—days he faced when in
Rome, how painful to himself, how far from credit-
able to myself, his father-in-law.

And so I am neither awaiting the issue of this
affair 1n Spain-f² of which I have satisfied myself that
your letter gives a true account, nor have Ι any
crafty policy in my head. If ever there is to be a
state, there will surely be room in it for me3 if not,
you will yourself‚ I imagine, come to those same
desolate regions in which you hear that I have
settled down. But maybe Ι am only raving, and
everything will turn out better than we expect. I
call to mind the fits of despair to which those folks
were subject who were old men when I was a lad:
perhaps I am now following their example, and
indulging the weakness of my age. I hope it may
be so3 and yet.

Ι expect you have been told that Oppius is having ’ἶ
