EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, Ι. ix.

as regards Vatinius,“ however, you clearly indicate
your desire to know what induced me to defend and
eulogize him. To give you a plainer explanation of
this it is necessary that Ι should go a little further
back into the reasons of my policy.

At the beginning‚⁶ thanks to the course of events
and to your exertions, my dear Lentulus, I imagined
that Ι had been restored not to my friends alone
but to the commonwealth, and that while to you I
owed an almost incredible affection and every act
of extreme and peculiar devotion to your-sels, to the
Republic, seeing that it had aided you greatly in my
restoration, I considered that, by reason of its own
deserving‚I assuredly owed a regard such as previ-
ously I had displayed as owing to it because of the
common obligation of all citizens, and not because
of any signal service done to myself. That I was
of this mind the Senate was told by my own lips
in your consulship, and you yourself must have
observed it in our conversations and interviews.

And yet even in those early days there were
many things that caused me beart-hurnings, when,
as you were dealing with the general aspects of my
position in the state, I detected signs either of the
covert hatred of certain persons, or of their doubtful
support of my cause. For neither in the matter of
my memorial buildings ⁶ were you helped by those

ὓ i.e. “ of my restoration.''

⁶ “ Cicero may here refer (1) to his own house or a portion
of it, (2) to the neighbouring colonnade of Catulus, destroyed
by Clodius, but rebuilt by the Senate's order, (3) or perhaps to
some building which Cicero as consul was commissioned by
the Senate to erect in commemoration of the suppression of
Catiline’s conspiracy ” (Watson).
