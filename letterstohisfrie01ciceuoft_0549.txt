EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. m.

and so Ι undoubtedly was3 I was afraid that that
would come to pass, which actually did happen,—
am now on the contrary afraid of nothing, and
there is no contingency for which I am not prepared.
While some degree of precaution seemed practic-
able, it pained me to see that precaution neglected 3
as it is, however, amid this universal ruin, when a
policy of prudence can do no good, it seems that the
one course left to us is to bear whatever happens
with sels-restraint, especially since death is the end
of all things, and my conscience tells me that as
long as I had the chance Ι took steps to protect the
dignity, and when that was lost, that I was eager to
maintain the safety, of the Republic.
I have written thus, not because I want to talk 2

about myself, but so that you, who have always
been so closely associated with me both in conviction
and aspiration, may indulge in the same reflections.
For it is no small consolation when you recollect
that, even if affairs have turned out badly, you at
any rate were incontrovertibly right in your opinions.
And I do pray that the day will come when we
may enjoy some form or other of stable government,
and compare notes together on the anxious days
we passed through, when we were suspected of
timidity‚ because we declared that that would
happen which actually took place.

As regards your own affairs, I emphatically 3
assure you that, apart from the ruin of the Republic
as a whole, you have nothing to fear ; while as regards
myself, I beg of you to think this of me—-that to
the best of my ability, I shall always be at hand
to promote your own welfare and that of your
children with the utmost possible zeal.
