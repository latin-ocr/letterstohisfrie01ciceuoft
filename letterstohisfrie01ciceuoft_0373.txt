EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, V. 1v.-v.

pray of you, as earnestly as I may without straining
your courtesy, to save your kinsfolk by saving me
also, rather than be induced to attack me on account
of the arrogance and ruthlessness of your kinsfolk.“
You have won a victory over yourself so far as to lay
aside certain private enmities ὁ of your own in the
interests of the state ς will you ever be prompted to
countenance the enmities of others to the prejudice
of the state ?

But if, with your usual clemency, you now give
me your help, I assure you that I shall be in all
respects wholly at your service 3 if, however, owing
to that system of violence which has triumphed
over me and the state together, the magistracy‚ the
Senate, and the people are alike forbidden to come
to my aid, then, I say, beware lest, if at any time you
should desire to recall this opportunity of saving us
all, you may not be able to do so, because there will
be nobody left to save.

ΤΟ GAIUS ANTONIUS ⁰ IN MACEDONIA
Rome, January, 61 13.c.

I had certainly resolved to send you no letters
except letters of introduction—not that I gathered
that even these had as much weight with you as I
should like, but so as not to give those who asked me
for them reason to suspect any loosening of the ties
which bind us. Now that Pomponius, however, a
man who knows better than anybody all the energy
Catilina, and of extortion as Governor of Macedonia. Though

defended by Cicero he was condemned and retired to
Cephallenia.
