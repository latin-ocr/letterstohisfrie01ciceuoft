CICERO To P. ΒΙΤΤΙυὲζᾸι SON OF PUBLIUS
52 1³.c.(?).‘

It is not because I have forgotten our friendship 1
or wilfully broken off my customary correspondence
with you that Ι have sent you no letter for some years
past. No ; it is because the earlier part of that
period was sunk in the common ruin of the state and
myself, while during the later part of it I found a
difficulty in writing to you on account of your own
most unmerited and distressing troubles. Now,
however, after a sufficiently long interval and a more
searching consideration of your admirable character
and high courage, I have thought it no deviation from
the course I have set myself to send you these words.

Well, my dear P. Sittius, how have I treated you ? 2
[n those earliest days when you were being ill-
naturedly attacked in your absence, and even had a
criminal charge brought against you, it was I who
defended you 3 and because, when your most
intimate friend ⁶ was under trial and in danger, a
charge against yourself was involved in that against
him, I spared no pains in safeguarding you and your
cause ; and quite recently, just after my return,
although I found that proceedings had been begun
in a way that would not at all have satisfied me had
I been on the spot, still in no single respect did I
fail to promote your welfare3 and again, when, as

ὓ Ρ. Sulla, accused of aiding Catiline‚ was defended by
Cicero and acquitted.
