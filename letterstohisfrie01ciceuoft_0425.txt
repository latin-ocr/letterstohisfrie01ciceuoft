Although there is nobody in the world less fitted 1
to offer you consolation, since your tribulations have
caused me such sorrow that I am myself in need of
consolation, still, seeing that my own sorrow was
further removed from the bitterness of most in-
tense grief than was yours, Ι decided that it was due
to our close connexion and my friendly feeling for
you that I should not remain so long silent while
you are in such affliction, but shouldoffer you some
such measure of consolation as might mitigate, if it
could not succeed in remedying, your sorrow.

Now there is a form of consolation, extremely 2
commonplace I grant you, which we ought always
to have on our lips and in our hearts—to remember
that we are human beings‚ born under a law which
renders our life a target for all theslings and arrows
of fortune, and that it is not for us to refuse to live
under the conditions of our birth, nor to resent so
impatiently the misfortunes we can by no process of
forethought avoid, but, by recalling to mind what
has befallen others, to induce the reflection that
what has happened to ourselves is nothing new.
