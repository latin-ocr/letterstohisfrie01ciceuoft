EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, II. xv.

M. Τ. CICERO, IMPERATOR, To THE SAME

Sida, early in August, 50 1³.c.

Nothing could have been more correct or sensible 1
than your action in conjunction with Curio in the
matter of my supplicatio0‘3 and, really and truly,
the business has been carried through to my entire
satisfaction‚ not only in point of dispatch, but also
because the man who was so angry, the candidate
who opposed you and myself too at the polls‚⁶
concurred with the man who honoured my achieve-
ments with eulogies befitting a god. Be assured,
therefore, that I am hopeful about the next step03
see that you make ready for it.

As for Dolabella, I am glad, firstly, that you 2
speak well of him, secondly, that you are actually
attached to him; for when you express a hope of
his possible reformation by the discreet influence
of my dear Tullia, I know what letter of yoursd
that is intended to counterbalance. What if you
were to read the letter ‘³ I sent at the time, in con-
sequence of your letter, to Appius ? But what is one
to do? Such is life. What is done, may the gods
approve. I hope I shall find him a pleasant son-in-
law ; and there your kindheartedness will be a
great help to me.

The political outlook causes me great anxiety. 3
There’s Curio—I am favourably disposed towards
him; Χ Caesar—I sincerely wish him all honour;

⁶ No doubt he means the elaborate explanation he offered
to Appius in iii. 12.
