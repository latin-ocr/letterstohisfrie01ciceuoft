EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. xxn.

most dear3 to take thought for your own safety
and that of those who are dependent upon you;
to apply to the present crisis all the lessons you have
learned, all the wisdom bequeathed you by the
greatest philosophers, which you have so admirably
stored in your memory and assimilated in mind from
the days of your early manhood3 and finally, to
bear, if not with calmness, at least with eourage,
your yearning for those bound to you by the strongest
ties of affection and a thousand acts of kindness—
the friends you have now lost.‘²

What Ι ean do myself, I know not, or rather I 3
feel that what I can do is all too little 3 this much,
however, I promise you, that whatever Ι deem con-
ducive to your welfare and honour, that I will do
with as much earnestness as you have consistently
shown, and effectively too, in dealing with my
affairs. These good intentions of mine I have
conveyed to your mother, who is the best of women
and most devoted to you.

If you send me any message, I shall aet in accord
anee with what I conceive to be your wishes; but
even if you fail to do so, I shall none the less attend
most zealously and assiduously to whatever I consider
to be to your advantage. Farewell.
