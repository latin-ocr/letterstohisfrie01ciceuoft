for the future. But if, as you write, the letter was
badly expressed, you maybe sure I never wrote it.
Just as Aristarchus⁶ says that a line to which he
objects is not Homer's,.so you (I will have my little
joke) must never suppose that what is badly expressed
was written by me. Farewell, and in your censor—
ship, if by this time you are censor, and I hope you are,
let your thoughts dwell much upon your aneestor.b

M. Τ. CICERO ΤΟ APPIUS CLAUDIUS PULCHER

Sida, early in August, 50 κιο.

First I shall congratulate you-—for that is what 1
the sequence of events demands—and then I shall
turn to my own affairs. Ι do indeed congratulate
you heartily on the result of the trial for bribery and
corruption, and not so much on the fact of your
acquittal, as to which nobody was in any doubt, but
on this, that the better you are as a citizen, the more
distinguished as a man, the more chivalrous as a
friend, the richer you are in the graces of courage
and energy, the more astonishing is it that not even
in the secrecy of the ballot was there found hidden
away any such ill-will as could venture to attack you
—a transaction not characteristic of these days, nor
of our modern men and manners. It is long since I
have been so much surprised at anything.

As regards myself, just assume for a moment the 2
part I have to play, and imagine yourself in my place 3
if you have no difficulty in hitting upon the right thing
to say, why,then consider my hesitancy unpardonable.
