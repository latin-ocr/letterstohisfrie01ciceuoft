which one Valerius, a banker, had taken over. Valerius
had to give sureties for his fulfilment of the conti-act, among
whom were Cicero's praefectus fabrum, Q. Lepta, and also
one of his leyati. When the money was called in by the
state, Valerius was unable to pay more than a portion of
it, and wished to transfer the obligation tobis princi al,
Volusius. The lawyers, Camillus in particular, decided Euat
the transference was ille al, and that, Valerius being in-
solvent, his sureties woul have to make good the deficit.

transference, and wishing to protect his persona friends
among the sureties, in his official accounts as proconsul
entered the balance due from Valerius as a “ bad debt '⁹ or
‘⁴ a remission‚’' in fact ‘⁶ wrote it off.‘’
