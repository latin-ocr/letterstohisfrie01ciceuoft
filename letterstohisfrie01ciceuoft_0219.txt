EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, 111. v1.

a very clear idea of the hurry you were in
to get away. My answer to Clodius was that I

had yet got hold of some plausible grounds for their
gossip, knowing nothing of my staunchness as a
friend, were trying to alienate my goodwill from you
by alleging that you were holding an assize at Tarsus,
