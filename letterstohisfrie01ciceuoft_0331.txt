EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IV. lx.—x.

it not possibly be the mark of a haughty spirit to
spurn that same conqueror's generosity, and if it be
the act of a philosopher to forgo one's country, may·
it not be a proof of sheer callousness not to yearn for
her ? And if by any chance you are unable to enjoy
a public life, it is surely senseless to refuso to enjoy
a private one. The main point is this, that if you
think your present life is more comfortable, you still
have to consider whether it is not less safe. There
is no limit to the licence of the sword, but in foreign
countries there is even less scruple in committing a
crime. For myself, so anxious am Ι about your
safety that I am on a par with your cousin Marcellus,
or at any rate I come next to him. For you it
remains to make the best of your opportunities and
to take thought for your rights as a citizen, your life,
and your property.

TO THE SAME
Rome, January, 45 1³.c.

Though I have no news to tell you, and am begin·
ning to look forward more to a letter from you, or
rather your arrival in person, still, as Theophilus is
setting out, I felt it impossible to give him nothing
in the way of a letter. Take care then to come as
soon as possible ; for believe me, your coming will end
a period of eager expectancy, not only among us, by
which I mean your friends, but among all without
exception. For it sometimes occurs to me to have
a lurking apprehension that the delay in your leaving
for home is not displeasing to you.
