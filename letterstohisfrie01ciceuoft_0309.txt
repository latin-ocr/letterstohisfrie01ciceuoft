EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IV. v.

Finally, never forget thatxyou are Cicero, one who
has ever been wont to instruct and advise others;
and do not imitate bad physicians who, in treating the
diseases of others, profess to have mastered the whole
art of healing, but themselves they cannot cure ; nay,
rather apply to yourself and set before your own mind
the precepts you so often seek to impress upon others.

There is no grief that is not diminished and miti· 6
gated by the lapse of years. To await that lapse,
instead of hastening to forestall the effect by apply-
ing your wisdom, is not creditable to you. But if
there be any consciousness even among the dead‚s
such was your daughter’s love for yourself and affee-
tion for all her family, that this at any rate is not
what she would have you do. Offer this as a tribute
to her who has passed away3 to your friends and
comrades‚ for your sorrow is their own ί to your
country, so that if there be any need for , she may
have the benefit of your assistance and advice. '¹‘

One last word—since fate has brought us to such a
pass that we are compelled to give consideration
even to such a matter-dd not make the mistake of
giving anybody grounds for suspecting that it is not
so much your daughter's death that is the cause of
your mourning, as the critical state of public affairs
and the triumph of our opponents.

1 am ashamed to write at greater length to you on
this subject, lest I seem to have lost confidence in
your good sense. Therefore, when I have put forward
this one point, I will bring my letter to a close.
We have observed on several occasions that you
bear good fortune with admirable sels—control, and
thereby gain much credit; make a point of convin-
cing us at last that you can bear misfortune equally
