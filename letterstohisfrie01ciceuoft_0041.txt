EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, Ι. 1.

we are in favour of your being authorized to restore
the king, ‘⁸ so far as you can do so without detriment
to the state '’ ; so that while the religious difficulty
eliminates the army, the Senate retains you to
manage the whole affair. Crassus votes for three com-
missioners, not excluding Pompey, for he extends the
selection even to those who happen to be in the enjoy-
ment of imperiumst Bibulus votes for three com-
missionem, to be chosen definitely from those who
have no imperium. The other consulars agree with
Bibulus, excepting Servilius, who declares that there
ought to be no restoration at all; and Volcatius,
who, on the motion of Lupus, votes for the appoint-
ment of Pompey3 and Afranius, who agrees with
Volcatius. And this increases the suspicion that
Pompey desires the appointment, for it was noticed
that his friends agreed with Volcatius. We are griev-
ously embarrassed, and we have lost ground? The
hurried meetings and fussy anxiety of Libo and·
Hypsaeus,⁰ about which there is no concealment, and
the zeal of all Pompey’s intimates, have created the
impression that Pompey seems bent on being ap-
pointed, and those who would reject him are at the
same time nofriends of yours, because of the appoint-
ment you secured him.

For myself, I carry the less weight in the affair
because I am in your debt, and any desire there is
to please me is crushed by a notion people have
that they are pleasing Pompey.

We stand much as we did long before you left ; the
king himself and Pompey’s friends and associates
have secretly inflamed the sore, then the consulars
have openly made things worse and aroused strong
popular prejudice. My own loyalty will be acknow-
