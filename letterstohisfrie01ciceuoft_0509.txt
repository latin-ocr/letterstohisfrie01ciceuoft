EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VI. vm.

Tmy request that you should remain in Sicily as long
as you desired it, adding that they would guarantee
your doing so would not in the slightest degree affect
your interests. Now that you have been informed
what you are permitted to do, Ι think you ought to
know what my own idea' 15.

When all this had been settled a letter was de· 2
livered to me from you, in which you ask my advice
as to what I suggest you should do, whether you should
settle down in Sicily or set out to finish off your
arrears of business in Asia. Your discussing alter-
natives in this way did not seem to me to fit in with
what Largus said. He spoke to me in such a way
as to imply that you were not at liberty to remain
in Sicily any longer, whereas you discuss the ques-
tion as though that permission had been given you.
But whether the latter or the former is the truth,
my own opinion is that you ought to stay in Sicily.
The proximity of the island to Rome will help you,
whether' m carry ing your point by the frequent inter-
change of letters and messengers, or in expediting
your return, when the matter is either arranged
according to your request, as Ι hope it will be,
or settled once for all in some other way. And
that is why Ι am strongly of opinion that you ought

tolstsaffin recommend you with all earnestness to my 3

friend T. Furfanius Postumus α and his legates, who
are also my friends, when they arrive here ; for they
are all at Mutina. They are excellent fellows, fond
of men like yourself, and very intimate with me.
